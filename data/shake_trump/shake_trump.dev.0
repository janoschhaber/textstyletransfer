there 's honour in the theft .
`` i will but teach them to sing , and restore them to ''
what crows have peck 'd them here . he brags
the devil .
they swore that you were almost sick for me .
`` that calls me traitor , i return the lie . ''
`` and hath shipped me intil the land , ''
`` for revels , dances , masks and merry hours ''
`` for tittles ? titles ; for thyself ? me . thus , ''
and i am sent to be revenged on him .
where ?
motley-minded gentleman that i have so often met in
so graze as you find pasture .
`` well , juliet , i will lie with thee to-night . ''
`` did hang a salt-fish on his hook , which he ''
`` out , scab ! ''
`` but must condemn it now . desist , and drink . ''
`` turning the widows ' tears , the orphans ' cries ''
`` we term it , his friends whilst he 's in directitude . ''
as good go a mile on his errand .
`` of valour ; and drive the gentleman , as i know his ''
`` at home , he had lived . ''
`` but let him swear so , and he shall not stay , ''
`` i dare not confess that , lest i should compare with ''
`` those that we bury back , our monuments ''
i am sure the duke
`` art thou not second woman in the realm , ''
these but the trappings and the suits of woe .
our whole city is much bound to him .
no leisure had he to enrank his men ;
your grace has given a precedent of wisdom
`` once more unto the breach , dear friends , once more ; ''
`` 'help , ho ! they murder caesar ! ' who 's within ? ''
`` we 'll rest us , hermia , if you think it good , ''
`` corrupted , and exempt from ancient gentry ? ''
thy tender-hefted nature shall not give
`` i told you what would come of this : beseech you , ''
`` happy be theseus , our renowned duke ! ''
`` is there any unkindness between my lord and you , monsieur ? ''
`` of his salt and most hidden loose affection ? why , ''
`` out of the bowels of the harmless earth , ''
`` how now , sir proteus ! how now , thurio ! ''
`` pray you , sir , whose daughter ? ''
show 'd like a stubble-land at harvest-home ;
`` [ within ] who 's there ? what , ho ! ''
to appoint some of your council presently
the quarrel is between our masters and us their men .
if you love an addle egg as well as you love an idle
`` that sun , i pray , may never set ! i have told him ''
`` sir john ! art thou there , my deer ? my male deer ? ''
that covenants may be kept on either hand .
`` and but thou love me , let them find me here : ''
it is now apparent ?
`` 'i am conqueror of myself . ' thou art sworn , eros , ''
who 's there ? what 's the matter ? will you beat
save that we do the denunciation lack
`` before his chaps be stain 'd with crimson blood , ''
`` which i have done , because unworthily ''
and baited it with all the unmuzzled thoughts
these eyes ? i can not tell ; i think not : i will not
i think he would not wish himself any where but
such proverb so little kin to the purpose .
`` via , goodman dull ! thou hast spoken no word all this while . ''
`` la , la , la , la ! 'nothing doubting , ' says he ? alas , ''
`` but do not so . i have five hundred crowns , ''
`` penitent , as thou callest him , and reconciled king , ''
`` alas , my lord , what do you mean by that ? ''
that very oft we pity enemies .
`` stand back , thou manifest conspirator , ''
that he believes himself : so do not i .
`` lady , you have . pray you , peruse that letter . ''
`` sir , but you shall come to it , by your honour 's ''
`` do me but right , and you must all confess ''
`` no more do yours : your virtues , gentle master , ''

i wish your highness
`` what i command , i 'll rack thee with old cramps , ''
`` than some , whose tailors are as dear as yours , ''

`` oh ! oh ! a while , but ha ! ha ! ha ! ''
leaves tarsus and again embarks . he swears
`` my love , without retention or restraint , ''
`` for which the people 's prayers still fall upon you , ''
`` why , 't is a cockle or a walnut-shell , ''
`` poins ! poins , and be hanged ! poins ! ''
`` elder-gun , that a poor and private displeasure can ''
so said her woman ; and that her sufferance made

false allegations to o'erthrow his state ?
march gently on to meet him .
`` anon , i 'm sure , the duke himself in person ''
for ever the society of men .

`` hast thou or word , or wit , or impudence , ''
`` if i do not put on a sober habit , ''
`` how durst you , villains , bring it from the dresser , ''
before mine uncle : i 'll observe his looks ;
