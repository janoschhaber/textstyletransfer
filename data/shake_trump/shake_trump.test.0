to make thee capable .
and soon at supper-time i 'll visit you

but not every man patient after the noble temper of

my daughter weeps : she will not part with you ;
as thou didst kill our tender brother rutland ;

will you prepare you for this masque tonight ?

for forty ducats is too much to lose .
`` that sweet aspect of princes , and their ruin , ''
i see these witches are afraid of swords .
`` which by thy younger brother is supplied , ''
this tongue that runs so roundly in thy head
what more commands he ?
therefore accept such kindness as i can .
`` in such a place , such sum or sums as are ''

is not more ugly to the thing that helps it

there 's the point .
this is thy sheath ;

it is the most impenetrable cur
i shoot thee at the swain .

`` an if she do , i would i were an eunuch . ''
this hateful imperfection of her eyes :
`` what ! will you fly , and leave lord talbot ? ''
be so perfidious ! -- he whom next thyself
`` the thanksgiving before meat , do relish the petition ''
`` why , be so still ; here 's nobody will steal that from ''
`` because she will admit no kind of suit , ''
`` speechless complainer , i will learn thy thought ; ''
hath no drowning mark upon him ; his complexion is
may the winds blow till they have waken 'd death !
who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning
this union shall do more than battery can
`` i understand thy kisses and thou mine , ''
`` marry that will , i live and die a maid : ''
blessed be your royal grace !
`` so tediously away . the poor condemned english , ''
`` what mercy can you render him , antonio ? ''
`` her coffin ! no news of them ? why , so : and i know ''
`` what , my lord ! dispraise ? ''
and julia herself hath brought it hither .
`` uncle , give me your hands : nay , dry your eyes ; ''
`` come , i will have thee ; but , by this light , i take ''
`` i 'll through and through you ! and , thou great-sized coward , ''
`` now , great thetis ' son ! ''
all things is ready . how near is our master ?
`` lord , let me never have a cause to sigh , ''
`` are not alike ; alas , good neighbour ! ''
unless you have the grace by your fair prayer
bound to answer the particular endings of his
`` when one so great begins to rage , he 's hunted ''
against their will . but who comes here ?
`` galling the gleaned land with hot assays , ''
`` companion , hence ! ''
let 's hear . o fie ! the treble jars .
the hand that hath made you fair hath made you good :
with a wench .
that you do bend your eye on vacancy
`` in prenzie guards ! dost thou think , claudio ? ''
sins of my mother should be visited upon me .
`` come now , your one thing . ''
`` aaron , what shall i say unto the empress ? ''
`` ha ! let me see : ay , give it me , it 's mine : ''
`` done , let the law go whistle : i warrant you . ''
playing in the wanton air :
you know it is the feast of lupercal .
often resort unto this gentlewoman ?
to soften angelo : and that 's my pith of business
`` boldness comes to me now , and brings me heart . ''
`` i may say so , when i please . ''
take no unkindness of his hasty words :
adieu ; be happy !
`` the slave , a member of the country 's peace , ''
`` when he shall come to his account , he knows not ''
in venice they do let heaven see the pranks
`` that have outlived the eagle , page thy heels , ''
`` but few of any sort , and none of name . ''
and in this state she gallops night by night
whether you had not sometime in your life
true ; out indeed .
`` bate , i beseech you , widow dido . ''
`` their counsel turns to passion , which before ''
though yet she speak not . mark a little while .
vouching -- and upon warrant of bloody
`` must gently be preserved , cherish 'd , and kept : ''
`` as you , my lord , or any scot that this day lives : ''
`` to our attempts . am i not stay 'd for , cinna ? ''
but that i know love is begun by time ;
and soon i 'll rid you from the fear of them .
`` it with stamped coin , not stabbing steel ; therefore ''
world ! one that is well-nigh worn to pieces with
`` cassio shall have my place . and , sir , tonight , ''
`` go not about ; my love hath i n't a bond , ''
there 's not a one of them but in his house
`` and , which is worse , within thy nasty mouth ! ''
please you dismiss me either with 'ay ' or 'no . '
`` do you love me , master ? no ? ''
`` establish 'd then this law ; to wit , no female ''
`` withhold revenge , dear god ! 't is not my fault , ''
under my feet i stamp thy cardinal 's hat :
`` 'faith , yes , to be put to the arbitrement of swords , ''
`` by my troth , the fool has an excellent breast . i ''
with burial amongst their ancestors :
`` being a beast , she would have me ; but that she , ''
what is't you say ?
`` promising to bring it to the porpentine , ''
`` and will , no doubt , shortly be rid of me . ''
than that which hath no foil to set it off .
`` when were you wont to be so full of songs , sirrah ? ''
`` lo , hand in hand , lucius and i will fall . ''
ay .
i have sworn 't .
would i not leap upright .
`` and so , though yours , not yours . prove it so , ''
`` ay , that 's well known : ''
`` a trembling contribution ! why , we take ''
`` for the gods are quick of ear , and i am sworn ''
`` i prithee , hear me speak . ''
`` which , in the day of battle , tire thee more ''
unto the wished haven of my bliss .
`` of tybalt deaf to peace , but that he tilts ''
`` which is from my remembrance ! please you , farther . ''
`` you , and so now i speak my agitation of the matter : ''
`` this sport , well carried , shall be chronicled . ''
long live edward the fourth !
`` appropriation to his own good parts , that he can ''
as pure as sin with baptism .
`` thus , in this strange and sad habiliment , ''
from whence he intercepted did return
give me your favour : my dull brain was wrought
we purpose her no shame : give her what comforts
`` my lord , 't is but begun . ''
`` but , like a lackey , from the rise to set ''
`` and that high royalty was ne'er pluck 'd off , ''
`` as thou and i ; who , as thou know'st , are dear ''
makest thou this shame thy pastime ?
have made thee fear 'd and honour 'd of the people :
i would cozen the man of his wife and do his service .
`` for tinctures , stains , relics and cognizance . ''
a goodly person : he hath lost his fellows
we must not now displease him .
her amber hair for foul hath amber quoted .
`` a scar nobly got , or a noble scar , is a good livery ''
`` when i shal l dwell with worms , and my poor name ''
`` springs not from edward 's well-meant honest love , ''
but now thou seem'st a coward .
`` sound , sound alarum ! we will rush on them . ''
still revelling like lords till all be gone ;
if that she learn not of her eye to look :
achilles will not to the field to-morrow .
`` swine-keeping , from eating draff and husks . a mad ''
`` by my life , she will do as i do . ''
my name is brook ; only for a jest .
`` but was a race of heaven : they are so still , ''
should be lamed with reasons and the other mad
digressing from the valour of a man ;
soft ! who are you ? sir walter blunt : there 's honour
`` nathaniel 's coat , sir , was not fully made , ''
`` wife . 'rivo ! ' says the drunkard . call in ribs , call in tallow . ''
that you are now a maid . thus then in brief :
`` their tribunes for ever . this lies glowing , i can ''
`` in limited professions . rascal thieves , ''
`` burthen [ dispersedly , within ''
`` cassio , my lord , hath kill 'd a young venetian ''
`` no , antony , take the lot : but , first ''
i believe you ;
`` my hounds are bred out of the spartan kind , ''
and bring in cloudy night immediately .
`` but fortune . coragio , bully-monster , coragio ! ''
one sorel .
thus must i from the smoke into the smother ;
`` for a hen ! so , my good window of lattice , fare thee ''
`` my lord of somerset will keep me here , ''
ever lost : 't is too cold a companion ; away with 't !
`` 'say , the firm roman to great egypt sends ''
`` and prove it too , against mine honour aught , ''
`` avoid that too , with an if . i knew when seven ''
`` neither the king , nor he that loves him best , ''
`` not cassio kill 'd ! then murder 's out of tune , ''
be silent ; let 's see further .
helenus . i think he went not forth to-day . that 's helenus .
what are you there ? your names ?
that hath dishonour 'd all our family ;
`` look , here comes a lover of mine and a lover of hers . ''
`` with all the cunning manner of our flight , ''
my throat to thee and to thy ancient malice ;
`` didst thou but know the inly touch of love , ''
`` says , is muddied withal : pray you , sir , use the ''
`` mother looks , and my father died within these two hours . ''
`` no , by the flame of yonder glorious heaven , ''
farewell : the leisure and the fearful time
`` shall seem a dream and fruitless vision , ''
`` welcome , brave captain and victorious lord ! ''
`` by your leave , sir : i am sick till i see her . ''
surrender of his will but offend us .
`` upon advice , hath drawn my love from her ; ''
greater that i am subdued . would the cook were of
`` o perjured woman ! thou dost stone my heart , ''
thou gavest thine ears like tapsters that bid welcome
it was a worthy building . how ! a page !
