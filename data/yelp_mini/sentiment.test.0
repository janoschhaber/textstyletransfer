the $ _num_ minimum charge to use a credit card is also annoying .
sorry but i do n't get the rave reviews for this place .
the desserts were very bland .
the cake portion was extremely light and a bit dry .
it was super dry and had a weird taste to the entire slice .
once again , i have n't figured out why they change so much .
consistently slow .
even in the awkward freezer burn then microwaved scent .
so nasty .
i hate mayonnaise .
my goodness it was so gross .
i ca n't even handle how gross it was .
went here for the first time to try something new ... bad idea .
expensive , lack luster burgers .
would not recommend .
the `` chicken '' strip were paper thin oddly flavored strips .
the big chicken sandwich should be called the big mayonnaise sandwich .
fries are n't worth coming back .
now the service i experienced was bad .
i ended up here by accident ( not a happy accident ) .
the chicken tenders did n't taste like chicken , wtf ?
so i only had half of the regular fries and my soda .
horrible !
crap fries , hard hamburger buns , burger tasted like crap !
i 'm so disappointed !
but service was horrible both times .
gross .
the spicy chicken sandwich was small and basically all lettuce .
sorry they closed so many stores .
the people behind the counter were not friendly whatsoever .
i wanted to like this place so badly .
charging $ _num_ for an extra shot in an espresso drink is plain ridiculous .
i just got a plain ole cup of joe .
so i waited 10+ minutes and after the fact they said its $ _num_ .
had they informed me of the charge i would n't have waited .
that 's why they get the score i gave them .
if i could give them a zero star review i would !
however my recent visit there made me change my mind entirely .
sorry not my style nor taste .
- oh and terrible tea !
they close earlier than posted hours .
i wish i could give zero stars .
i really really wish i could .
this place does not provide adequate care to any of its horses .
you provided none of those services for our $ _num_ !
that leaves you no excuse .
all play and no work makes horse owners sincerely pissed off .
i wont even get in to how badly you treat your dude string horses .
how sick .
you do n't deserve any animals !
cons : a cockroach problem that has n't been fixed by the management company .
the interior is old and generally falling apart .
tl ; dr version at bottom .
this place is bad news !
still down btw ) .
quickly found out they like to close for `` breaks '' all day .
old managers always gave us discounts , but melissa refused .
which was _num_ am , every morning , for weeks .
flat tires everywhere !
worst was when we had to break our lease early .
it was never done .
tl ; dr version : sketchy as hell !
if you do , make sure you get everything in writing !
these people will try to screw you over !
okay so this place has been a pain even after i already moved out .
the last months were the worst .
the shower has backed up with sewage two times in a _num_ day period .
you will find both in your apartment , without fail .
front office : customer service does n't exist here .
they are clueless .
there is not enough parking for the amount of cars per apartment .
if i could give less than a star , i would .
maintenance is equally incompetent .
mission rock have done none of those things .
about two weeks later , my ac broke ( in august ! )
this apartment community is horrific !
my college daughter has had the worst experience living here .
i have never had pizza like this in chicago .
it was a bed of lettuce and spinach with some italian meats and cheeses .
not impressed .
i asked wtf and they did adjust it when i complained .
village inn , home run inn .
i do not like anybody 's pan pizza in phoenix .
not good enough to go back and eat the pizza for though .
i am just not a fan of this kind of pizza .
just not for me .
the crust was kinda gooey like .
they were really nice i just ca n't stand this kind of pizza .
however the atmosphere lacked , mainly because there were no tvs or music playing .
the sauce was way too sweet for my taste .
a pre-made frozen pie shell is what they are using .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
pizzeria bianco - sit down joint .
no delivery option though !
_num_ .
too many good artisan pizza places in town do go back .
i have spent more money on bad pizza than i like to think about .
it is a pretty efficient way to get patrons in and out .
the pie showed up shortly after the salad was consumed .
defiantly not my favorite pie .
unfortunately , the sauce pretty much overwhelmed the other ingredients .
almost tasted like honey barbeque sauce instead of pizza sauce .
the answer was none .
this place sucks .
we have been there _num_ times , with an attempted 3rd time .
1st time , burnt pizza , was horrible .
wo n't go back .
also like all spinatos they are closed on monday .
the food was bland ... if you like spinatos , just avoid this location .
it 's not worth it .
friendly staff , but not overly helpful .
we got the thicker crust and it tasted really dry and hard .
the pizza sauce is also way too sweet .
it tasted more like a dessert some bites .
too sweet for me , but maybe you 're into that ?
pretty disappointed it did n't live up to the hype .
the sweet sauce was not that great either .
mozzarella had very little cheese flavor .
over priced , poor value .
first time i had a bad experience here .
server brought it out to me having not asked which one i wanted .
super annoying to find that out during the meal .
constantly got in peoples way as they were trying to sit down .
really dissapointed wo n't go back .
however this was a huge disappointment .
italian sub would have been delicious except for the over cooked roast beef added .
it was gross .
the flavoring was off .
very disappointing .
unfortunately , our experience did not live up to others ' experiences .
bad move !
the italian sausage and peppers , however , were fine .
`` , check took another _num_ minutes .
they updated their meatball sub and it is awful ?
we use to go 1-2 times a week and we have n't been back !
they do n't seem to care either .
sorry spinatos you made a huge mistake .
may be only the bread to you but that bread made the sandwich .
it use to hold the meatballs in and it was not messy .
raise the price do not lower the standard of quality .
now i am at home with lots of crust and no sauce .
this was not the case .
personally i 'd rather spend my money at a business that appreciates my business .
great pizza but no wine or beer !
thats just not italian !
the bad service of the waitresses make me dread going sometimes .
and if i go , i 'll pay cash and sit at the bar .
i 've noticed the food service sliding down hill quickly this year .
to my surprise , they were completely out of wings .
we never want to let a loyal customer down .
no contact what so ever .
bars must be a bad business for making money .
i drink beer so ill still be a paying customer .
no one was shooting on it because the lights where burnt out above it .
how much do _num_ light bulbs cost these days ?
i will miss your patio and cheap , cheap appetizers .
this place leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to decor .
my family popped in for a bite after they got off the plane .
Positive
which is pretty bad since they 're not really ones to give negative feedback .
if you 're feeling lucky , go check it out .
v is for very , very , extra ordinary .
not extraordinary , kids - just ordinary .
i was disappointed after having been spoiled with the great pho other places .
i am truly annoyed and disappointed at this point .
but wait , what about the broth .
i ordered pho tai : the soup tasted salty , lacked depth i.e .
my pho was terrible .
just got off the plane and needed some lunch .
bottom line : disappointed !
worst experience ever .
customer service was bad .
the restaurant was dark and did n't even turn the lights on .
it was n't for the mood either , probably to save electric bills .
the water tasted bad , and worst of all , the food tasted horrible .
never going back .
pho tasted bland .
seems their broth just has no flavor kick to it .
it 's not terrible but there are better pho places out there in tempe .
terrible service !
i tried once before and i thought it might be a fluke .
went back today and the service was even worse .
i walked in and sat down at the only available table .
the waitress dropped off the menu without ever looking at me .
i wiped the spilled pho and hot sauce down with napkins .
eventually , my pho was dropped off at my table .
i seriously do n't know how the place manages to pass health inspections .
what a disappointment .
do not , i repeat , do not waste your money at this place .
thankfully i did n't order pho because the bowl my buddy got looked terrible .
greasy layer of fatty broth .
pretty much a hole in the wall status but it was n't good .
the only plus was that the service was decent .
i would n't recommend coming here .
i went to the grow shop and the same bag was _num_ !
they only want your money at sea of green .
_num_ weeks and a lot of bus fare later - part still not in .
i hate this place now , and you should too .
what a terrible way to treat a customer .
they had one ... but not cheap at all !
the replacement was expensive .
one not so bad time does not make me loyal .
the older man there said it would be $ _num_ .
$ _num_ ?
that is not how you make & keep customers in the long run .
what a ridiculous thing to say .
very low integrity bike shop .
larry came out and allowed me to take it for a spin .
afterwards he proceeded to build up the bike as an awesome deal .
`` well those walmart bikes are poor quality .
that 's why i 'm returning the bike . ''
i ( and apparently many other customers on yelp ) recommend shopping somewhere else .
this place is garbage !
worst sales experience ever !
edit : after reading more reviews it appears they do this often !
this was hands down the worst sushi i 've ever had .
my tempura was undercooked and gooey on the inside .
my husband 's meal was tiny and drowned in overly salty brown sauce .
seven hours later i finally arrived at my chosen destination ... crazy fish .
i kinda really wish i 'd gone somewhere else .
not so good .
my boyfriend and i went there one night .
it was n't that the place was busy -- far from it .
overall , i would not return to this place .
should n't have bothered .
gross .
i placed a to-go order for my sick partner .
and then charged me nine dollars for it .
but salmon and cream cheese is $ _num_ .
expired in _num_ .
sub par sushi ( at best ) and terrible service !
big mistake .
he never said hello , or even looked us in the eye .
needless to say , we left the restaurant and will never return .
never again , crazy fish .
the only reason why i gave it _num_ stars is because of the staff .
terrible .
ripoff !
pissed off and will never go back again !
no wonder you have no customers .
do n't waste your time or money .
i should have know when i walked in and there were only _num_ tables .
i think i 'm going to be sick .
they overcharge and the service advisor lied to me about my car .
i went back , paid my $ _num_ and picked up my car .
he found nothing on my car to work on .
they quoted $ _num_ .
so they wanted to charge me another $ _num_ to fix this .
after they said it was fixed just a week prior .
i went back about six months later to just get an oil change .
for a dealership to tell him he did n't need work was amazing .
avoid this place !
you will get robbed here by very friendly mechanics .
the next three companies that came in where all significantly under their quote .
no nothing .
waited _num_ hours and i did not even receive a phone call .
that night the air conditioner kept running and the temperature never dropped .
before i wrote this review i made sure it would continue to work properly .
it 's a few weeks later and i have had no problems .
i 've experienced better , much better .
the prices are too high , the food is mediocre .
there are too many better lunch options in the area .
what happened to them , on saturday they looked like they were doing business .
from the moment you walk in you can tell the employees hate being there .
probably never going there again .
i got to the counter and they literally would not let me use it .
so disappointing ... .
they come in plenty of flavors like red , green , orange , etc .
it was fun then , but i got older , it wore on me .
with the summer heat , fat tuesdays frozen drinks are appreciated .
i think i have hated fat tuesdays since they started opening in the valley .
the loud music will probably never let you down however .
apparently i stand corrected and this place is still open .
being in this bar makes me feel dirty .
the music is always insanely loud ( and not even good , usually ) .
fat tuesday 's is one of my least favorite places on mill ave .
i 've never had the food but the drinks are so-so .
avoid .
and i should hate it .
the national drink of the florida keys is the rum runner .
it 's a cocktail that is pretty much impossible to find north of miami .
but fat tuesday 's has it .
well , all fat tuesday 's besides this one .
whoever had that idea should be fired .
if your like frozen drinks , this is your place .
but i want more than just frozen cocktails at a bar .
i went here this past saturday and the place was packed .
somebody needs to get bar rescue into this place .
the atmosphere was too dark and somewhat musty .
the bartender who finally welcomed me was arrogant and lazy .
if he was trying to be funny , it did n't work .
the worst thing any business can do is to insult the customer .
what a disappointment .
sadly , fat tuesday does not hold a candle to it .
mainly because the bartender was so incredibly rude .
um , i 'm sorry ?
did you just laugh at a buying customer for their drink order ?
i wanted so badly to love this place .
it 's that bad .
not because of the alcohol in my drink , but because of the sugar .
it was like they dumped _num_ lbs of sugar in each machine .
not _num_ minutes after finishing my drink .
you do n't charge $ _num_ for very little , bland tasting crawfish !
the crawfish itself was small too .
i do n't think i had more than _num_ whole crawfish .
i wish i can post a picture to justify my disappointment .
was actually there tonight .
it was so sugary that i did n't want it .
so lame it makes me laugh .
oh wait , not i 'm not .
i was sad that modern tequila bar closed .
i will never ever , ever , ever , ever go here again .
when i asked who his boss was he refused to give that info .
very poor service .
worst customer service i have ever received in a long time .
do n't waste your time .
absolutely no point .
horrible experience !
not prepared for world cup .
she said game would be over , before i would got food .
she said they did n't have enough time to prep food .
should have left but i did n't want to miss game .
and leave the single person with poor service !
if i could give a zero star i would .
verdict : i wo n't be back .
if i could give this place zero stars i would .
fortunately i caught myself and did n't fall onto their nasty floor .
i had n't even drank anything yet .
bull .
very disappointing .
do not go to this establishment .
hence i would not recommend them or use their printing services again .
ick .
just ick .
they gave us a smoking room even though we requested non-smoking .
why smoking rooms even exist anymore are beyond me .
like $ _num_ - $ _num_ .
outdated hotel for the price , room i was in was dirty .
the less than good - really low shower heads .
no extra blankets or pillows in the room .
* tub would not drain & remained half full !
unsatisfied !
this one is the worst we have ever stayed in .
i later printed out the reservation and the desk reduced the rate .
no tv remote in the room .
the comforter on one bed smelled like pee .
i still have n't received it .
we were really disgusted !
the front desk staff were helpful though thankfully and gave us a full refund .
horrible place !
i feel as though possibly i just have high standards for thrift stores .
okay despite everyone 's glowing reviews this place is absurd !
we left without making a purchase and i will not be back .
i hate that .
they have bottles stuck here and there all over the place .
but i ca n't get over the awful service .
i guess i 'm spoiled when it comes to liquor stores .
_num_ ) absolutely no organization in the wine section .
ick .
_num_ ) the aisle are ridiculously tiny .
thank goodness the store was empty tonight .
_num_ ) almost half of the wine and liquor bottles were covered in dust !
it does n't take that much effort to clean up the store .
that just seems like a sin .
( cheaper than texas , not as cheap as cali . )
it 's not worth your time .
my wife and i recently attempted to patronize this liquor store .
what a disaster this place is .
i have never had a more frustrating experience in a liquor store .
the problem is , i was n't looking for beer .
immediately , i know something was wrong .
i show him the list of _num_ or so bottles on my iphone .
never coming back here ; sketchy employees and overpriced beer .
seriously probably the worst corner store ever .
the staff are ... well , you could n't hire worse individuals .
great selection of beer at reasonable prices , what 's not to love ?
i 'm dumb .
i apologized immediately .
he says nothing and does n't even acknowledge me .
tops liquor , this guy is losing you business .
just be warned if buying beer here to check this sort of stuff .
my food arrives quickly after i finish trying the eggroll .
finally , after over a week , mike called me .
_num_ hours later i called at the number he gave me ... voice mail .
no call back whatsoever .
luckily , a competitor that did call back got the job .
they have n't done anything after we signed the contract _num_ months ago .
do not use this company !
i have spent _num_ separate stays here .
i was quite disappointed and ate only half the fish .
but again i was greatly disappointed in the food .
there was a police report on the seat .
the sheraton did not even attempt to contact us & tell us what happened .
this happened _num_ or _num_ days before we came home .
the sheraton did nothing in the way of covering the broken window up .
they would not even refund our money we had paid for parking .
what a horrible representation this person , william is for sheraton .
my experience here was terrible !
could have stayed at the w for that money !
rather not stay here again tho .
i was not very pleased with the quality of this hotel .
-the a/c is not good .
actually , i 'm sitting in a hilton room as i type this .
was the experience awful ?
am i staying during my next trip ?
would i stay here again if i had too ?
ordered room service , the food was cold .
wo n't stay there again .
sometimes it was difficult getting hot water in the showers .
the room instantly filled with an overwhelming smell of burning death .
then every _num_ minutes or so i would hear planes pass by right above .
do not stay in room _num_ or around there .
i find this appalling and ridiculous .
furthermore , i will never give priceline my business again either .
hotel is clean but extremely dated .
carpet is worn , wallpaper coming off the walls and bathrooms with minimal lighting .
this hotel has been a nightmare to deal with ... not calling back .
i was sorely disappointed .
at this point i have no further expectations .
i will not go back to this hotel again .
i was very disappointed .
i provided feedback after my stay via the automatic email that i received .
this hotel is tired , dingy , and in poor repair .
i might be back , hopefully the hotel will be updated .
the carpeting looked kind of dirty and it was musty smelling too .
breakfast was weird .
the wifi is horrible .
the air conditioner was noisy .
wall paper in the bathroom was ugly and looked cheap .
the air conditioner did n't work very well which is a problem in arizona .
you 'd have better luck finding gold then an ice machine here .
i left three messages without a call back .
our stay over the weekend here was horrible .
we were lied to on many occasion by different staff and they were rude .
nick at the front desk even started yelling at one of our friends .
it would not close all the way shut .
the gentleman was really apologetic and immediately gave me a new room .
does n't cleaning staff report this ?
i actually selected this location based on _num_ things : _num_ proximity to airport .
_num_ price _num_ gym .
their only weight machine was out of order .
the conference room was even out of order .
i could n't even connect in my room .
i reported this twice and nothing was done .
one girl just said , `` that stinks . ''
the breakfast is not a deal by booking in advance .
the front desk refused to assist .
first day at breakfast was horrible .
no clean tables .
there is water damage on the first floor so the rooms smell .
the overhead light in my room does n't work .
so not worth it .
worst sheraton in the country .
they recently renovated rooms but should have renovated management and staff .
rooms smell bad , are still dated .
food is horrible .
we catered for meeting and we would have done better going to mcdonald 's .
disgusting .
the sandwiches not so good .
recently , the ownership and menu changed and with it went everything else .
in addition , the service has gotten significantly slower .
actually , most of my office has stopped going there .
actually , most of my office has stopped going there .
this will be my first _num_ star review .
well , i am disappointed to say the least .
took over an hour and _num_ minutes for my food .
everything was very chaotic and the wait times were absolutely ridiculous .
it was disgusting .
the potatoes were n't done .
the toast was burnt as well .
it was impossible to eat .
i was a regular until the new owners purchased the business .
another _num_ minutes for my coffee to arrive .
i was neglected from this point forward .
for $ _num_ there should be more food there .
veggie omelet - $ _num_ + $ _num_ for cheese .
this omelet is tasteless and has an oily feel in my mouth .
gross .
this came with a side of cold , soggy potatoes , also flavorless .
did all my appointments to get this .
the staff is rude and the dr. does not spend time with you .
i cant rate him he gets a _num_ in my book .
i read other reviews on him and all were bad .
they had no empathy for my pain if it was n't headache related .
it 's really quite sad that this is the business model they chose .
the first time i went to this place , i got a veggie yakisoba .
the second time i went i got a tofu veggie thing over rice .
i could not believe my ears lol .
almost no meat .
bulgogi was not well seasoned .
the food was bland and nasty .
was not worth the _num_ bucks .
would not go back again .
new ownership came , they changed the recipes so now it 's gone downhill .
i miss the old tokyo stop .
ordered the chicken katsu and it was not fresh .
for lunch , i had the vegetable bowl combo and crab puffs .
not to mention , the flavor of the teriyaki sauce was a little bland .
we both were very disappointed .
the food was terrible .
she took _num_ bites and was afraid to eat more .
this is not authentic japanese cuisine .
katsu is not katsu , fried chicken bits .
katsu sauce they offer is a plum sauce , horrible .
i would not recommend this place to friends .
no seasoning , no flavor .
the katsu was old and had zero flavor & below average dipping sauce .
absolutely the worst place i 've eaten in .
it smelled like shit and the whole udon bowl tasted so disgusting .
too much carrot and overall , not worth the price you pay .
not going back to this place ever .
the pork slices were dry and bland .
not even a good soak in the just salty broth could wake it up .
not a ramen stop by any means .
really not impressed .
very dry .
not appetizing .
and the katsu was over-cooked and somewhat tough .
i would give the ramen _num_ stars .
i had a bite of my wife 's yakisoba .
it was ok , not great .
maybe _num_ or _num_ stars .
you 're bound to be disappointed .
i had to call them _num_ hours later to see if it was done .
_num_ dollars to put the tires on !
i dropped my car off at _num_ to get tires and alignment .
no one bothered to help or track this guy down while i was waiting .
this guy was ridiculous .
worst service and experience ever !
initially quoted $ _num_ .
it ends up being _num_ .
if you can tell a little lie , you can tell a big lie .
customer service manager asks what the problem is .
total _num_ .
i also tell him my battery is dead .
_num_ days later i call @ 11am .
they did n't even call me .
i asked about my discounts , oh yeah !
i just want my car and pay it .
they hang me my key .
do n't even tell me where my car is .
get in , it does n't start .
they never replaced my battery .
i end up going to another garage for the battery .
awful awful awful .
do not reccomend it at all !
the worst people to let near your car !
they rip you off and to a terrible job !
only come here if you enjoy throwing your money away .
this place is in absolute joke !
avoid avoid avoid !
no big deal they forgot i guess .
do yourself a favor and avoid this shop at all costs .
i have no idea how to fix anything wrong with a car .
it was a cold , rainy day .
their customer service was terrible .
so i really just wanted to leave .
they got me the gas cap like _num_ mins later .
they did n't act professional at all .
by far the worst car service i 've ever had .
be prepared to stay for hours no matter what they tell you .
however , they never tell you what 's required and what is not .
they just try to suck money out of you .
i mean what kind of trash operating are they running ?
they are awful !
absolutely horrible , stay away if you can .
these guys honestly do not even deserve one star .
do not take your vehicle here even for an oil change .
they are the absolute worst .
i set foot in this store just once , and i never will again .
worst customer service ever .
in short they are crooks who will charge you money for unnecessary part replacement .
cost me a total of $ _num_ .
useless people .
you ca n't even talk to the mechanic unless you insist .
neither should anyone else .
go on their google reviews and see see how bad it is .
it 's pathetic !
i wish i could give them zero stars .
worst experience ever .
manager had no customer service skills and would n't even talk to me .
i was not told in the beginning that i needed _num_ tires .
which it had never done before .
they charged me $ _num_ and make my car worse .
do not go here !
worst service possible .
will there be a 3rd visit ?
when i get to the car , turns out my battery is dead .
i really wish i could give this location less than one star .
finally i was told it was there but they could n't find it .
i just felt that they really dropped the ball on this one .
worse mistake of my life .
took a whole week , ordered the wrong part .
i 'm pissed !
_num_ rating .
do n't even let them change your oil !
i had to call several times to get updates .
so i browse the store then go sit down .
glad they double checked , that 's why i give _num_ stars .
other than that it 's a total waste of time .
first off , two of the filets we ordered were not filets .
seriously , that 's just rude .
first off , i do n't complain to get free stuff .
she did n't offer a new filet .
there was _num_ of us so we ended up here one dead sunday afternoon .
the place was dead not a soul in site and dark as hell inside .
dont let that fool you though , she didnt move any faster .
their sandwiches are bad and over price .
on top of that , the service is very slow .
the service is incredibly slow even when the place is empty .
not very good overall , but pretty good for tempe .
i do n't like going to downtown tempe .
this place should be a museum not a steak house .
it tasted old and dusty .
as others have noted , this is a dark place .
another thing to realize is that it is huge .
prices are way too high for the quality of food they are selling .
unfortunately , i 've been spoiled by better , more expensive steak restaurants .
the waiting area had shirts that you could buy .
my first side of spaghetti was bleh .
i added a small packet of sugar which made it more tolerable .
little over $ _num_ for two after tip .
a prime rib was substituted , and it was ok , but nothing special .
flavorless and dry .
ate way too much of it .
the menu prices have gone up significantly .
the food was mediocre at best .
it is a very hard way to cook a steak .
the rice was bad , just bad .
it was over cooked , mushy , and surprising , it was cold !
final thoughts - it is too inexpensive to call themselves a steakhouse .
the food , service and experience is worthless and the steak was sub-par .
the fried zucchini i ordered was also hard and tasted really bad .
one of the worst dining experiences that i 've had .
for a steakhouse , i was not impressed .
excuse me , is that how they wait tables here in az ?
he never mentioned that milk refills would be extra .
the bread was the only item all of us enjoyed .
horrible !
terrible !
do n't eat here !
though we intended to come for dinner , we never made it past appetizers .
anyway , the empanadas came super hard and over cooked .
this place should seriously be on kitchen nightmares .
monti 's used to be so good ... now it 's awful .
i wish they would bring back their old menu and food .
we stayed bad move !
i ordered the chicken marsala with a baked potato and mixed vegetables .
she ordered a hamburger with the works with fries and chicken noodle soup .
this place with such a long history it should be killer .
such a disappointing experience !
it was horrible to say the least .
but the food is really not that great .
i want to like it , but it 's really not that good .
it tasted fine , but not a $ _num_ dish .
unfortunately , we had a miserable experience .
the first thing to arrive at our table was our steak .
two waiters showed up with plates and put them down .
they left at high speed without any acknowledgement .
two bites into the salad , we were brought our steaks .
they obviously had been put under a warmer as they were overcooked .
we asked what was going on as we had been rushed all night long .
caesar salad and then an _num_ oz .
filet and baked potato ( also really small ) .
the steak was edible , but not delectable .
the food : this is the reason for the low rating .
she could not eat it .
somebody in the kitchen needs to know about that fish and chips dish .
no biggie .
it took a good _num_ minutes to get our food .
good steak is hard to find , but bad steak can be gotten anywhere .
sadly , i wo n't be going back .
took it down the street and spent money , elsewhere .
took an out of town , corporate guest here tonight .
our poor waiter , though very nice , was not very attentive .
i do not blame him though .
another _num_ to get our appetizer of spinach and artichoke dip .
the spaghetti i ordered was was just meh , nothing fantastic .
i was very disappointed that the restaurant did n't live up to my expectations .
this place is just way too big .
food was terrible !
prime rib was rubbery and dry .
potato was overcooked and burnt .
service was poor .
the waiter and then manager were both rude .
food was terrible !
prime rib was rubbery and dry .
potato was overcooked and burnt .
service was poor .
the waiter and then manager were both rude .
so disappointed .
we had n't been to monti 's in quite awhile .
no ambiance at all other than the tin ceilings .
i did n't even get to go in and try the food or drinks .
it was an event day on mill which means parking sucks .
the service was only fair , at best .
waited _num_ min for food , as did several other tables .
offered _num_ % off of my steak only !
so , a $ _num_ comp on a $ _num_ bill .
we had a party of _num_ , so big check .
this was a mistake .
steak was not good , chewy , texas road house has a better steak .
some had incorrectly cooked steak .
needless to say , we will not be back .
the famous `` roman bread '' is nothing special .
it is not bad , it 's just not special any way .
on the bright side , the place is pretty cheap .
this was one of the worst dining experiences in a long time .
_num_ tray of food , _num_ tray of drinks and _num_ near misses .
i explained that the ratio was way off and he just said .
the entire meal was just ok .
the shrimp salad is so-so .
i was not impressed with the location .
the food was nothing special and the service was slow .
in addition , the restaurant was either really cold or really hot .
of the great places in tempe , this would not be a return visit .
something 's very wrong at monti 's .
regulars , most of whom were over _num_ .
there was a peach pit .
still hurts , but it 's only been a few days .
i 've seen better customer service at drive-through windows .
the room was not ready .
waiter did nothing but upsell your menu .
he was like a used car salesman .
by the time the sides came out the food was cold .
your guac had huge pieces of avocado that was n't seasoned .
everyone for the most part thought this was a horrific evening .
do not go here , it is awful .
worst steak in years !
i took family members and am now so embarrassed .
did n't seem to care .
way overpriced for an old run down business .
just returned from a disappointing meal .
my husband 's prime rib was also almost more fat than prime rib .
unfortunately , we wo n't be going back again .
i ordered sea bass but i was actually served tilapia .
three words : not worth it .
the bread was ok , my salad was ok , my meal was ok .
the service was terrible .
the waitress was incompetent .
or to know the very limited drinks list .
it was ridiculous .
clearly i expected better out of a restaurant with such a reputation .
the prime rib , ny and ribeye steaks were all cold and seriously undercooked .
sent the prime rib and ny back and they were replaced properly cooked .
not a good idea for a nye dinner service !
even over looking the price the quality was not there .
also the salad no longer included with the entre .
ordered the ribeye with a baked potato and grilled vegetables .
server did n't tell me that the grilled vegetables were just really salty broccoli .
the ribeye was cooked correctly but was thin , dry and tough .
the total for just me for the meal including tip was $ _num_ .
prime rib was tough and over cooked .
atmosphere is ok.
i will not be coming back because of the food .
had the bone in new york and it was cooked to perfection .
so why did i just give this place a _num_ star rating ?
because the service was terrible !
wish i have n't .
it was also fatty , chewy , and had no seasoning .
the server brought out a short rib .
_num_ min later he came back and said he has it wrong .
the baked potato , mashed potatoes , and clam chowder were descent .
the chipotle mac and cheese needed more cheese and the was too watery .
the table next to us also had similar problems .
the server seemed nice but he could n't get his act together .
but lunch was not good .
the food was not good .
just very disappointing all together .
it was so bad this is my first bad review i have ever wrote .
our waitress was slow but she was n't horrible it was a busy night .
the level of quality was less than i am used to .
i would not go back .
if i want steak i would go anywhere else .
always .
this place was awful from the get go .
my party all had n't arrived yet so we could n't be seated .
no one else is trying to eat at your restaurant !
gross .
skip it , and get a steak instead for the price .
my partner got the sirloin and said it was overcooked .
will not be returning .
my main complaint is the slow service and confusion on the server 's part .
i would n't recommend this place for large parties .
brought clients here and waiter reeked of cigarette smoke .
come on management no one wants smokers handling their food and drinks .
not impressed .
the unfortunate part of the evening was the rib eye steak .
the steak its self was very disappointing .
it was prepared well , just a poor quality of meat .
about _num_ % of the reason anyone goes here .
the steaks were awful .
absolutely , no seasoning .
the asparagus was not trimmed nor seasoned .
terrible .
simply awful !
sad ... very sad indeed .
overpriced bikes and bad service .
huge waste of time on these guys .
these get a well deserved _num_ star for terrible first impressions .
pancakes are from a packet mix , frozen packet homestyle potatoes meat was microwaved .
no forks , no thanks , nothing .
price - if you are a corporate customer , grab your wallet and run .
fast service .
portion sizes are a bit smaller here .
i waited _num_ minutes after the estimated delivery time and called .
wont be calling this place again .
the car ran rough .
i paid in total _num_ in parts and labor .
i filed a complaint with the bbb and my problem was never resolved .
he told me it would be $ _num_ .
$ _num_ for _num_ seconds of work ?
no thank you .
she then told me i was disturbing the other patients !
this was ridiculous !
the lady said it is standard to wait _num_ to _num_ 1/2 hours .
there is one doctor and they must schedule _num_ people for each time slot !
waited _num_ 1/2 hours just for the doctor to fill out a prescription refill .
ridiculous !
what the hell are you doing back there when your waiting room is packed ?
it 's not fair and its beyond inconsiderate !
this place is awful .
the waiting area is dirty and unappealing .
i left because of the fact that they were so rude .
she did n't know the answers to basic questions .
i would highly recommend driving further to tucson or surrounding areas .
i do n't trust the doctors or whoever runs this company .
honestly , the worst _num_ hours of my life .
it 's typical to wait a little bit , as doctors are very busy .
i went back into my room and the door opened a second later .
a few of my friends are staying here and i went to visit them .
everything about the hotel needs a complete update .
the tv did not really work good .
i think i could feel the springs in the mattress .
it just felt a little dirty to me .
this is a terrible hotel .
the internet is not free ( greedy ) .
the breakfast is not free ( ihop is next door , though ) .
the shuttle took _num_ minutes to get me from the airport .
the tv channels are limited .
save your money and go to a nicer place .
this hotel is as awful as it gets .
the room was $ _num_ !
it 's a rip-off .
cons : the key cards here are incredibly bad quality .
wifi is expensive .
not worth it .
gross !
talk about _num_ hotel that has n't had renovations !
i did n't want to stay and thank god it was only two nights .
that was the only plus !
i could n't believe my eyes !
not the best experience all around for this place .
not a great place to stay .
also wifi is not free .
so that was $ _num_ and a day wasted down the drain .
it was a complete waste of money .
i will not be going back .
i always feel rushed and the staff is typically rude .
they nail technicians have been really rough and it hurts !
i should n't dread getting pampered .
it took another _num_ minutes for them to be ready .
the manicure began to chip within _num_ hours of having it done .
i did not like this place .
they are fast like many have said , but you feel really rushed .
i tried to refuse saying i worried they 'd damage my natural nails .
lastly , i tried to refuse saying it would take too long .
i hate this place .
i wo n't go back .
they do n't care about you .
i would encourage you to seek service elsewhere .
prob one of the worst manicures i 've had .
and it 's been _num_ minutes and my nails are still wet ?
thats after we kept them under the fan forever bc they wouldnt dry .
the first few times i went there , it was just fine .
the manicure was rushed and sloppy and my pedicure is all over the place .
there is polish on the skin and not even full coverage on the nails .
sorry uni but i will not be back .
probably the worst nail salon i 've ever been to .
once was great , the second and most recent time was awful .
do n't go there , their work is inconsistent at best .
unfortunately , i was the one getting the manicure .
i arrived , checked in and was told to pick out my polish color .
i go to pay and tell them that my manicure was really short .
they tell me it 's because i did n't get polish on my nails .
so , apparently they rush you through the pedicures here too .
_num_ minutes is way too short for a pedicure .
i am dying to take a photo but feel like that might be inappropriate .
wo n't be back .
not satisfied at all !
worst .
i walk in _num_ minutes before my appointment .
i feel like i was n't greeted properly .
they told me to sign in and sit down .
and i sat there for _num_ minutes .
i gave em the `` _num_ min '' benefit of the doubt .
it was extremely painful and i felt like they were inconsiderate on my needs .
uneven paint .
i will not return to this salon .
i will not recommend this place .
do not waste your time and money !
if you value good customer service this is not the right place .
very rude nail techs !
waste of money , long wait time , and rude employees .
disappointed and not coming back .
i have requested not to have her because of this .
i was _num_ mins late the past _num_ times but seriously .
this just happened to me again today hence why i decided to write this .
i will not be going back .
beyond irritated does n't even begin to explain it .
if you choose to come here , you 've been warned .
i just had surgery for the third time .
bad business .
shame on you for taking advantage of my mom .
... ... okay now wait for the ultimate response from the waiter !
house of tricks was marginal at best .
the worst part was that there was no music or background noise at all .
with only _num_ other tables , it was very awkward all night .
the service , again was just ok.
our waiter was a bit too attentive .
overall , i 'd look elsewhere before going .
food was moderate and exceptionally overpriced .
my 25th birthday : a reason to celebrate .
it was explained to me as a roasted butternut squash soup .
no one ever said that it would be indian squash soup .
very similar to the taste of pho ( vietnamese noodle soup ) .
in fact , it tasted almost identical without the soup .
bland bland bland .
the couscous accompaniment tasted like nothing .
we were poorly mistaken .
all in all : a $ _num_ disaster .
side note : this menu is n't even seasonal .
nasty .
the food is n't stellar for how much it costs .
the menu was nothing special , typical phoenix restaurant choices .
they ran out of the scallop dish at 7pm .
and my mashed potatoes were cold .
gf thinks the mussels were good though .
i had a terrible dining experience at house of tricks .
the last time i stopped in at hot was with clients for a lunch .
absolute disaster .
and it was late may so we could have used them .
not good in my book .
needless to say , i have n't been back .
complete disappointment .
slow service , the food tasted like last night 's leftovers .
have you never eaten at a good restaurant before ?
the atmosphere is very romantic and intimate .
so imagine my surprise when our food this last visit was very sub par .
for the quality of food we recieved , we were robbed .
do n't be fooled !
our choice should have been burger king for the service , if nothing else .
sorry , no disrespect to those who wear the crown ; - ) .
if you eat there do n't expect any `` wow '' from the food .
in this economy arizona has seen the doors of many restaurants shut .
not really .
we ordered three caesar salads and a bowl of soup , and our entrees .
apologized , and said he would comp the salads and cup of soup .
the wine was a $ _num_ bottle of wine they paid $ _num_ for .
he should have comped it , too .
that 's not enough anymore in this day and age .
it is unfortunate that it happens to anyone , but for us its unacceptable .
the owner tried to replace my jacket with a cheaper one .
anyways , my cold food was not that great and the experience really sucked .
we had the worse service there this past tuesday night .
added $ _num_ !
but , alas , i was disappointed .
a basket of cold bread was brought to us .
soup was lukewarm when it came , salad was good .
waiter does n't show up till we are done with this portion .
but the food was lukewarm when it was brought to us .
over all i would not recommend house of tricks to anyone .
it was mediocre at best .
this will go down in the anniversary dining book as should have gone elsewhere .
extremely limited vegetarian options .
bad service and food was just okay , not great by any means .
our waiter could n't have been more disinterested in showing any signs of friendliness !
i only ate the white meat part .
the risotto was not cooked properly , was borderline mushy .
no apologies from the waiter were offered !
i would not recommend house of tricks and will not go back there again .
the food ( salmon & short ribs ) was just okay .
there was a small dot of something hot on the side of the plate .
not cheap either , $ _num_ for dinner with _num_ glasses of wine .
i ate there last weekend with a group of _num_ .
this is possibly the worst service i have experienced at a restaurant .
ok fine but no apology , no management anywhere to be seen .
just an excuse .
this restaurant is very expensive so to be treated like that was unacceptable .
we sit outside and the dinner takes over _num_ hours .
the first _num_ times i went and ate the beef .
the server took it back and _num_ minutes later returned it .
i visited house of tricks for a friday business lunch .
you want your check before that point , usually .
the dressing was ok but too little of it .
the chicken was dry .
i wo n't be back .
food was good but the service was the worst ive ever had .
$ _num_ more to be exact !
the problem is that it took what felt like forever to get our food .
had the filet and it was a little bland .
my salmon was very fishy .
that should have been the first bad sign .
no complimentary breadsticks or anything waiting for the food to come out .
seafood salad was extremely fishy - was not fresh seafood .
wrong .
fish was dry and either overlooked , or not fresh .
i realized this appetizer was going to be completely different , and it was .
the bison was sort of dry and the main flavor was salt .
i went last night with _num_ friends and the place was a ghost town .
our waiters and waitresses were slow and seemed to have no training .
if smoking bothers you avoid this place .
the food is so blah !
not worth it .
he wo n't go back .
we had very poor service .
the cocktails we had made by matt were awesome as always .
i 'm a total foodie ... see my reviews .
_num_ ) the over sauce everything !
ask for all sauces on the side !
we were not impressed with our dining experience last night .
she quickly walked away leaving us to clean up the mess .
the pork belly appetizer was just ok as was the butter fish .
attention to detail is sorely lacking .
my experience was poor .
i chose the beef tenderloin and my date chose the fish .
the meat by the rib bone was not even cooked .
the fat by the rib bone was still gummy and white .
my friends orders a seafood dish with various small chunks of dried out seafood .
the decor and building were cheap .
boar was very appetizing .
not the same place at all .
shame was a favorite not anymore though .
sorry about the low tip !
food was excellent but service in the bar area was awful !
the _num_ bartenders sat at talked while we were sitting with empty drinks !
will not be back !
was very disappointed with our last visit .
the waiter was pleasant enough but not very attentive .
we were in great company so in no way was it a bad evening .
nor did they even care to return our call to discuss what had occurred .
this was my first time at this restaurant with my girlfriend .
it started off poorly with checking in with the hostess .
granted , this is a college town .
however , if i was the owner , first impressions matter .
however , the food quality does not meet the price they are charging .
i had the beef tenderloin with a bacon reduced sauce .
not prime meat !
the exhaust vent had loads of dust .
it misses the mark in many small ways .
i doubt prices will change .
it just needs a little better attention to details .
i probably wo n't go back again .
scallops were under cooked and fish of the day was over cooked .
also the gnocchi is fried .
menu was n't clear and they were n't very good .
my daughter and i had a _num_ pm reservation last night .
it was very cold so i asked for a different table .
my daughter realized she left her purse and went back to get it .
we paid for that and it was just gone .
terrible terrible service .
i tried smoked salmon that was too dry for me .
disappointing experience ... not sure if i 'll be back .
they 've been open for far too long to continually have this same problem .
it was bland , not cooked properly and very underwhelming .
my boyfriend got the sirloin and it was dry and almost inedible .
the cut was bad and the sides were a joke .
had a horrible experience ... .
the waitress took forever to get to our table , about 10-15 minutes .
on top of that , my steak was not prepared right .
our waitress took _num_ minutes to take our order .
would not recommend !
dining was a disappointing experience in comparison .
it did n't set the best mood for the night .
it did n't make sense to me for a couple reasons .
if i go back , i will be sticking to the bar .
overall this place is overpriced for its not so exceptional quality and taste .
it has been some time since my last visit to hot .
not so much anymore .
the worst part for me was the service .
at one point i snapped at him because i had enough .
kinda sad it was so bad .
portion sizes are n't huge .
oh we also had a flourless chocolate brownie sundae .
service _num_ .
not when the cocktail and appetizer have n't even been served yet .
uh ... no thanks .
the server barely apologized .
raw , sewage , miserable !
i had the chicken for $ _num_ and it was ok .
it was a big year anniversary and we ca n't get it back .
i went here for my _num_ year wedding anniversary and was very disappointed .
my husband and i both left there feeling sick .
i will not be returning to this restaurant .
i got the worst food poisoning of my entire life .
we requested in indoor table and were quickly accommodated .
club sandwich was delicious , grilled chicken sandwich was dry and flavorless .
not rude or incompetent , just not attentive .
oh no , she said you 'd have to pay for it .
i said , you do nothing for a birthday ?
never going back .
the atmosphere outdoors was as others have stated fantastic .
the service and food was pretty marginal .
but we then waited nearly _num_ minutes for the entrees .
my short ribs were dry and my wife 's scallops were cold .
once finished we waited another _num_ minutes for the waiter to ask about deserts .
at this point we had been at the restaurant nearly _num_ hours .
what a disaster !
unbelievable .
the artichoke dip was cold and had no taste .
the bread pudding was heavy and tasteless .
i 'm not in a rush to get back .
terrible mother 's day .
rude service .
menu was awful and food was subpar .
drinks took a ridiculous amount of time .
what a disappointment .
horrible service .
meatloaf was n't so good .
would not recommend this place .
as per usual this was before drinks , tax and tip .
our bill for three was $ _num_ .
this felt really pricey for the house of tricks .
not sure if it is going downhill or just an off day .
_num_ of us were there for lunch .
somehow my order , hamburger , got lost .
not a big deal , it happens .
in addition to being well done , cold it was totally flavorless .
but , i guess shame on us for not asking .
she may have just been too embarrassed to come by .
service was fine , but food was pretty lackluster .
i ordered the tres leches cake with plum sauce on the side .
$ _num_ out the door for a very mediocre dinner .
not good !
will not return , bad service !
there are so many better places around mill .
the service is hit or miss .
stay away from the spicy margarita , that was really gross .
i know they always mess up my order and then over charge me .
?
i was seated quickly and my drink order was taken .
)
it was dry , tough and boring .
had the chicken sandwich , bread was stale .
sorely disappointed .
restaurant just does n't cut it anymore .
if given a choice for a tasty business lunch , look elsewhere .
i really like the clam chowder soup .
wow just saw this review of best and worst pizza 's to eat .
guess i wo n't be ordering that again .
Negative
if i could give this restaurant a negative rating i would .
we were repeat customers at this establishment , with no prior problems .
he was a gigantic asshole .
needless to say , i eventually gave up .
monday ... no call .
i called tuesday because i understand mondays suck .
no answer and the phone just rang and rang .
they may do great work but crappy customer service experience for me .
the parking is not that easy here , even if you arrived early .
they are counting on you to not go inside for the refund .
that 's why i think its shady .
for some reason , the pump would n't take my visa card .
painfully slow pump .
frustrating stop .
it failed to come on .
would n't boot at all .
they call me later that day to tell me to come pick it up .
we see you have windows _num_ ... we do n't support that .
problem fixed !
took me all of _num_ minutes .
excuse me ?
your business will not last until you improve your business model .
prices are very high and selection is very low .
this store is a poor excuse for a japanese market .
i was not that impressed .
did not buy anything as i did not see anything that i wanted .
absolutely absurd !
overall , i was really disappointed with their offerings .
awful , ca n't say too much more .
nearly empty shelves , poor , poor selection of goods .
they usually talk down to me and they are n't very helpful at all .
not worth it .
they are complete assholes .
buying pants from here is less reliable than goodwill .
the other shoe followed days later with the same cracking and splitting .
the others are rude as shit .
first of all , the service took way too long .
garbage .
unbelievable .
can i just say , i hate everything about this store .
they looked at me , and my stuff , like we were disgusting .
you only accept ugly clothes .
nope , i was n't even in the store .
i accidentally sold a pair of pants that my boyfriend did n't want sold .
he had the receipt , and the assistant manager said that would be okay .
this place is awful .
there service is snooty and horrible and almost everything is way over priced .
$ _num_ for a used t-shirt ?
no thank you .
selling can be a nightmare .
would that employee wear those items you 're selling ?
if not , then they likely wo n't take them .
come back later to a different employee , you might get a different result .
)
also , i have no idea why it took _num_ minutes .
it seemed very unprofessional to me .
i threw the coupon in the trash .
i very rarely find anything here that i like .
i 'm not really a fan of buffalo exchange .
this store did not have consignment store pricing .
it was decently priced and alot of it was super cute .
they have made the decision that you do not get bags .
this whole store was disappointing i guess .
as for selling stuff , the worst part is the staff .
bottom line , super disappointed all the way around .
complete waste of my time .
spent _num_ minutes driving there for them to accept _num_ things out of _num_ .
disappointed is the word i would use for this store .
i wish that i could give this location _num_ stars .
their clothing is tacky and trashy .
save yourself the high price tag and go to goodwill instead .
i was so disappointed that i drove all the way out here from mesa .
do n't waste your time getting ripped off here .
that 's _num_ % !
turns out they offered $ _num_ .
this store is crap .
also , do n't try to sell your clothes here .
these people are way too picky .
unfortunately not .
( thank god ) i like that they play hip hop on mill .
i hate the door staff .
i hate the bar staff .
i wish there were more people like him out there .
the floors were sticky and the whole bar smelled like rotten chicken wings .
it was a nightmare .
every thursday they have a wet t-shirt contest .
wrong answer !
hey those things are n't gon na pay for themselves !
what in the hell were we thinking by going here ?
i just want to get inside .
i ai n't going back .
that 's the only excuse you have for going to this place .
when you are that young , you simply do n't know any better .
$ _num_ cover on mill is never fun .
staff is n't always that friendly and drinks are n't usually that great .
thirsty thursday is the only thing going for this place .
a gas station with extremely watered down fuel .
this place is a hell hole .
i am really unhappy with the way the cut turned out .
i walk in a get a hello from the barber and that 's it .
so i sit down and grab a magazine .
turns out he does n't know much about football .
he does n't watch basketball .
it was n't a terrible haircut but definitely not what i was hoping for .
been here a couple of times thought i would write a review .
avoid the male barber with the black hair .
this is probably the worst barber shop .
after tracy 's left this place this place is going down .
also told customer `` stop lying '' .
there is many collision center in phoenix .
you do n't need any offensive language to your customer .
if people bring back their vehicle to you , do n't panic !
the repair took _num_ and a half month for a gas pump replacement .
after i payed them my money to fix the parts .
i drove it for _num_ minutes and the car still had problems .
after i paid them money to fix it ... .
some shady ass people i will no longer give them business .
until now that is .
to say i am disappointed is an understatement !
here 's where it goes bad .
still no call from jeremy either .
exclusive collision center is no longer in business people .
i only chose them because of the great reviews on yelp .
the passenger door has a ding in it even though it was supposedly replaced .
nope , still the same boring burgers .
i went here in november _num_ and was not impressed at all .
to me the guacamole is what does this place in .
i cant get over the use of frozen artificial guacamole .
the burgers are decent but could use a little improvement .
they just never have that juicy medium rare middle that i long for .
it 's not that i will never eat there .
i really do n't get what all the fuss is about .
there was really nothing special , nothing even average about the place .
but i do n't think i 'll be back .
no thanks .
but oh no , the burger nazi could n't leave it at that .
he just repeated exactly what he had said , this time even more defiantly .
forget it , i 'm never returning .
the food is tasty but eat it at your own risk ... .
i came here on a monday night around 9pm .
nothing too unique about the taste .
fries though were crispy and fried well .
the ambiance was pretty depressing .
this place is very affordable but the food is nothing special .
second , my dad makes better burgers .
you can find better , cheaper burgers at in-n-out .
it 's not like i was trying to skip out on him or anything .
the food was n't anything extraordinary .
you put your own toppings on , which were your standard toppings .
the fried zucchini were pretty good .
but the service is terrible and the burgers are mediocre .
the first time i went , my order was wrong .
i had to wait another few minutes for the guy to fry the bacon .
the cashier gave me a disgusted look and pointed at the cash only sign .
this place seems promising but ends up falling short .
the chuck box makes a good boring burger .
they fall short of their topping options .
the lettuce , tomato , onion , sauce , ect .
the do n't appreciate the value of fresh burger fixings .
sometimes you just have to be the odd ball out i guess .
the burgers are n't cooked to order .
the condiments are all sitting out and for some reason it bothers me .
i have no problem with old but dirty is a different story .
i will not be back .
i must be missing something ... just not my kind of place i guess .
too expensive for a regular burger .
everyone talked about this place and how great the burgers were .
in and out serves better burgers .
i think they like the idea of the place more then the actual food .
the guy checking us out was so rude .
nasty place , i will never go back .
i made a mistake coming here .
now i have no problem going into shit holes .
i really did n't want to touch anything it was that dirty .
talk about poor professionalism immediately called corporate and stepped outside and spoke to joe .
they did not fit him , so i wanted to return them .
this location leaves much to be desired though .
not posted ) .
i wo n't be wasting my time and money here again .
the worst part is a hide behind honesty when their just full of crap .
customer service and attitude of employees is awful .
run do n't walk from this business !
dave says nope i 'm booked that week .
only after you saw this yelp review .
recently reverse gear in my transmission quit working .
this was not done at tri city .
not impressed with this company .
i will not be ordering from this dominos again .
driver had a really bad attitude .
i apologized for the mix up and she said nothing .
i would never have been so rude to a customer .
corporate and stores ca n't figure out what they 're doing communication wise ... .
nothing special just a pizza , some wings , and a brownie .
extremely disappointed .
in this case nope , nothing , just thanks anyways .
total ripoff !
will not be back .
after another _num_ mins passed we just chose to leave .
i am so frustrated and will never return .
you are nasty pete , especially here in tempe .
!
down boy , down !
disgusting all around .
possibly even insulting .
ps : and wtf is up with not taking credit cards ?
they charge extra for their bad tartar sauce .
avoid .
pete 's made me furious .
the fries were limp and greasy .
the onion in the onion rings were non-existent , all breading .
you 're better off going to long john silver 's .
the same approach is taken with their fish patties .
so bad i do n't even know where to start .
i checked the ratings on yelp before visiting this place .
it was disgusting .
it was over priced for what it was and not worth it at all .
came out to just under $ _num_ .
the shrimp were flat out awful .
fried fish should have a light batter .
in fact , nothing should ever be fried in the batter they use .
i saved the worst for part of the meal for last .
that stuff was awful .
then why is the food so expensive ?
it certainly is n't high quality .
it certainly is n't any good .
bad fish + bad shrimp + bad sauce + bad fries = _num_ star .
worst fish and chips i have ever had .
and their pete 's sauce sucks hard .
this location sucks balls .
the guy taking over was n't a doll either .
the shrimps i got here were over battered and overcooked , though .
bad food and bad service .
i did n't eat what i bought and i wo n't be going back .
long john silver 's looks like gold compared to this place .
upon arriving home i see my hot food is sitting in styrofoam .
i do n't imagine this food ages well .
what a waste .
its greasy and bland .
also the red sauce ... yeah it 's gross .
second , service is appalling !
why are they so damn rude ?
they also do n't accept credit cards , or debit cards .
so i had to try again another time , that was my first experience .
this place has got to be breaking alot of health codes .
just take your business elsewhere .
i 'm sorry but i definitely will not be coming back .
fried shrimp were very tough and tasteless .
did n't try the chicken or burgers and wo n't be back .
the downtown mesa location is like another restaurant .
it is almost false advertising to call this pete 's !
no messy fish sandwich ?
are you kidding me ?
that 's like no big mac at mcdonald 's !
please comment and follow me for more reviews !
not a fan at all of this place .
all we could do was laugh ... this place is a joke .
the fries were bland - totally tasteless .
last time i checked without customers a business will probably close .
this new breading is gross .
if it ai n't broken do n't fix it .
this place is what gives fast food a bad name .
the staff not nice .
did n't care for our square fish or the sauce .
both of us ended up feeling and getting sick that night .
i do n't understand the appeal at all .
worst fish and chips in the valley !
this food was so nasty .
i got sick to my stomach .
all the bad reviews on this place i agree with .
gross beyond gross .
waited _num_ minutes at the the drive thru window for my food .
they sure did take my money within the first minute of pulling up though .
everything was bland and tasted like deep fried cardboard !
i 've never eaten here sober until last night .
i 'm at loss for words to really describe how terrible the food is .
just a here 's your order & having the window slammed .
the absolute worst `` fish '' and chips i have ever experienced .
fish sticks from the store were terrible -- no flavor at all .
and it took _num_ minutes for one order .
_num_ hour wait !
ridiculous wait !
no way !
the food was absolutely disgusting .
the fish and chips were soggy and tasted like they were microwaved .
the prices are ridiculous for the quality and quantity of food you are receiving .
to top it off the customer service is nonexistent .
do n't waste your money or time .
literally the worst place i 've ever eaten at for seafood .
the batter was worse than store bought fish sticks .
sadly , the fries were the best part .
around 9:00 am , i got a call from someone named sean .
upon having the car , oil changes takes a really long time .
that 's right , the actual dealer was better customer service than these people .
he gave me the list price .
i mentioned that i found the same car elsewhere for less .
he told me that i should buy it elsewhere .
he gave me a low price to trade my car in .
he is not someone i would have hired as a manger for my store .
he definately lost my business just by talking to him over the phone .
he is in no way professional .
i gave up and went home .
they lost a sale .
absolute hell .
*** trails is the walmart of head shops .
i would rate them zero stars if i could .
it wasnt busy , so i got in and out very fast .
my only _num_ complaints : my lettuce was white and brown .
not appetizing at all .
which to me is a no no .
the food was ok , a little pricey i think .
waited in line too long to order .
i checked my email and facebook and still no sandwich .
get back to the office which is only _num_ minutes away and dug in .
the turkey was bland and the bread soggy .
the place was quite small and a bit dingy feeling .
i did n't smell anything , which was surprising .
i was very disappointed .
the sandwich was absolutely flavorless !
this was not worth the money , not even close .
how sad is that !
i got an italian hoagie and the ingredients really were sub-par .
the garlic toast was also bland and over buttery soggy .
this one went to the trash .
first time trying this place not to happy .
there was no line and only a couple people sitting at tables .
sorry , this one 's a bit harsh for me !
customer service : poor .
working in the industry , i know these prices are ridiculous .
sadly , i 'll have to look elsewhere .
rip off much ?
it is not .
but $ _num_ for a single print is too much .
a ) drinks are extremely weak .
they give you tall glasses , but have very thin pours of liquor .
i was terribly bored my only visit here .
i immediately got a _num_ out , o , please ask me .
yes , i am giving this place _num_ darn star !
my phone was stolen there , seriously , why ?
they never returned my calls or offered to refund the money .
i would never in my life eat here .
completely outdated , old hotel .
very noisy .
it 's very close to airport , which equals noisy !
pillows are all flat and my a/c would n't stay on .
the walls are paper thin and it is noisy !
paper plates and plastic utensils .
do n't stay here unless you do n't like sleep .
first , there was poor communication with hotel about airport shuttle .
after lengthy wait , had to pay for cab .
upon arrival , found out the place is being remodeled .
the entire lobby is a disaster .
i asked for email confirmation stating this .
it 's a disaster .
not marriott standards ... or maybe it is .
marriott seems to be sliding while hilton is improving .
)
hot sweaty nights in phoenix as a result .
do n't stay here with small child .
two problems occurred when we stayed here with our _num_ month old .
there really is n't any excuse for not having a few more high chairs .
they checked me in quickly , and the place was clean .
total ripoff !
to add insult to injury , i was still starving when i left .
what a weak meal !
i 'll will never go back to this establishment again .
caffe boa is about as exciting as bulk trash pickup day .
oh , yeah , i get it .
it ended up sitting there getting cold while we ate the salad .
remember the variety of flavors and the attention to detail ?
there was nothing like it in tempe at the time .
the biggest complaint was that our service was awful .
we were n't dressed any more poorly than most of the people here .
and to add insult to injury , my drink was supposed to be flaming .
on my plate was a half order of salad and three ravioli .
i miss them all and want them back !
caffe boa used to have the best happy hour on mill .
the food tasted good , but man ... .
hard not to think that you 're getting taken for a ride here .
cafe boa appears to be an institution headed for disaster .
no sauce , just terrible .
all in all we ordered three bottles of wine ( for _num_ ! )
the bill came and only one of the bottles was 1/2 off .
clearly not our expectation .
wrong .
he simply said there was nothing `` more '' he could do .
for _num_ years caffe boa was my go to hh place .
now they have a handful of their worst ones .
i 've changed my rating from one star to two stars .
the wine list used to be incredible .
the prosciutto and melon is pretty weak , as is the cheese plate .
once again , i stand my my award winning wine list .
people like this are not the norm of course .
alas , you never called .
without you , i might have never found them .
having dined here many times before , the service is indeed usually much better .
the taste of basil is completely lost as is the balsamic vinegar .
not something we would recommend or order again .
they used to have several great salad options , now they only have three .
it looked like they have less pasta too .
it 's not like we took a long time to order .
when it finally came , my turkey sandwich was kinda blah .
even the red pepper mayo on it did n't add much life to it .
i want my old caffe boa back !
looking at the lunch menu i chose the meatball panini .
that 's when things went downhill .
can spaghetti be spaghetti without noodles ?
can a meatball panini be a meatball panini without meatballs ?
i think i 'll stick with defalco 's for my meatball sandwiches .
not even a water .
at this time , we were probably the third occupied table in the restaurant .
and a bit pretentious .
to be honest , none of the food was worth the price tag .
caf boa you 've lost me .
i was disappointed at my last lunch experience and this one takes the cake .
i miss my old modest reliable boa .
i felt specially taken advantage of and specially pissed off .
no one !
this new menu is as ridiculous as the prices for average food .
case in point : a $ _num_ lunch special ?
does n't sound very special to me .
the food is just ok - rather average .
strange happy hour menu - deep fried pork belly fat .
really greasy and gross .
two glasses of sangria actually put me out for _num_ days .
some strange kind of concoction that i would n't wish on an enemy .
no thanks - i 'll go elsewhere .
one of the worst dining experiences ever !
i ordered _num_ courses with wine paired with each course .
although the duck was cooked correctly , the rest of this dish was inedible !
last but not least , there was the dessert course .
hands down the worst preparation of creme brulee i have ever encountered .
there was a about _num_ people in the whole place .
the gnocchi were over pan seared and filled with grease .
i could n't finish the dish .
sadly , i thought the service and food were terrible .
at those prices average does n't cut it in my book .
the menu is kind of limited .
this place sucks .
they were not stuffed full of seafood , they had some seafood .
you do not get what you pay for here .
total disappointment .
however , no one came to greet us .
she did n't apologize for the situation .
she just said she would find someone .
we eventually got the beer but no bread .
could he not have mentioned that before we had to ask again ?
i will not go there again .
the only good thing was the ambiance .
_num_ .
then all of the sudden , he did have the time .
_num_ .
we walk in and half the tables in the place are empty .
they 're trying to get your bill up with alcohol sales .
_num_ .
_num_ .
it was $ _num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
it was tiny , about _num_ small pieces , and tasted gross .
the sauce reminded me of salt and vinegar chips .
_num_ .
_num_ .
over priced , disgusting scam .
i no like .
gross .
bland !
so so so so so boring .
the lobster ravioli may be the most overpriced , overrated dish on the menu .
$ _num_ for _num_ tiny ravioli ?
what 's worse is that the filling tasted like imitation crab .
it was the worst thing on the table .
a half portion is more than enough for the average individual for lunch .
unfortunately , that was the highlight of our meal .
a few things pissed me off because i absolutely love this place for dinner .
the `` brunch '' food was ok although it was nothing special or memorable .
failed attempt at good cuisine .
only place in the city to get rabbit but very poorly done .
a waste .
not a good meal .
i mean honestly , $ _num_ for their `` special fries ?
$ _num_ for bruschetta ?
however , my visit over the weekend was less than good .
the server was really slow .
there was n't much in the way for vegetarian options on their current menu .
neither of us wanted to finish the dish .
had we just left it at that , our experience may have been better .
so why the low stars ?
so , i returned .
i will not go back .
honestly , i ate bread to fill myself up .
i brought some leftovers home ... you want some ? ''
i 'll miss it a bit ... some of the food was amazing .
i wanted to like this place , i really did .
however , at that point , it went downhill so fast .
but then , our waitress was noticeably absent most of the time .
forever to get the bill .
just absolutely terrible service .
the staff missed or got multiple orders wrong , some never came at all .
$ _num_ for an appetizer size bowl of soup is absurd .
$ _num_ for a basic caesar salad ?
the food was all good , but terribly overpriced .
would return for the food , but not at these prices .
not cool !
tonight has been completely unacceptable !
it took more than _num_ minutes to take our order .
after waiting about _num_ minutes we were seated directly inside the front door .
justin suggested the macarons for dessert -- they were incredible !
did we get free wine for our wait ?
_num_ minutes later there was still no bread and no supper .
being hungry , tired and frustrated we left .
so far , no call .
i still have the stupid groupon to use .
an hour later , we still had n't received it .
i probably would have enjoyed it more had the service been better .
food is acceptable , service is terrible .
however , do n't always expect to have their daily offered selections available .
i will not be going back here a 4th time .
really , caffe boa , you know better .
because it sure did n't show up for brunch today .
i am not sure who remembers that this place had an old location .
the new place ... meh , not so much .
nowhere near as cozy , its more like a corporate bar .
oh caffe boa , i do n't even know where to start !
i am very disappointed caffe boa !
we were seated and had to wait 5-10 minutes for anyone to approach us .
the food was good but not at all worth the expensive prices .
there are much better restaurants in the area like house of tricks .
food takes forever to arrive , bread not refilled nor water .
_num_ dollars + _num_ dollars for meat for my pasta dish .
_num_ dollar fries did not arrive either .
all in all a lack luster experience .
bread brought out with the meal was hard and dry .
no butter or jam was offered .
it was n't fresh squeezed .
no complaints there .
all in all everything was less than acceptable .
sadly i wo n't be back .
cafe boa was just okay but there are way better places out there .
we spent close to $ _num_ for subpar dinning .
i probably wont come back here .
and my girlfriend chose a pasta and a salad .
none of the ingredients matched what we read .
the food was good , but the service was lackluster at best .
better luck next time !
probably one of the worst dining experiences in my life .
i was so embarrassed we took others here , too .
so , we arrive , after making a reservation for _num_ .
_num_ of the group order a cocktail .
immediately after that , it came out .
it was somewhat dry .
it appears that you are supposed to get bread before you meal .
we did n't even get offered any .
i really can not say enough bad things about this place and our experience .
came here for lunch with a friend and was disappointed .
to me , here is where it got a bit frustrating .
the piece of chicken seemed to be well breaded and fried too long .
overall , she was not impressed with her meal .
ridiculous i say !
the waitress was a nightmare !
overall great food but horrible service that turned me off to go there again .
and at that time , it was unbelievably good in every way .
i have been here twice and my main meals were terrible .
dry and flavorless , blah .
i said nope just a foodie who experienced terrible service and food .
it was worse than the first time .
no bread , no water .
not sure the hype here .
maybe both my times were bad ?
no , i do n't think so .
they must not taste their own food .
dry , flavorless , under seasoned and boring after the 3rd bite .
no thanks people .
i will never return to this place .
slow service , food was bland , and was way overpriced .
the only reason this place gets _num_ stars is because of the interior .
unfortunately for $ _num_ this left me hungry and craving some flavor .
there are better options in neighboring scottsdale or even in tempe .
skip this place .
sorry , boa .
what a waste of time and money .
cafe boa used to be a great place to dine .
im not sure why they even open the doors anymore ?
the f word !
i would n't waste a penny more on this old has been !
the problem was the waitress .
but the tea never came and the waitress never checked in on us .
we did n't even get any waters or the chance to flag her down .
just returned from my last visit to cafe boa .
i sit down to a filthy , paper menu .
not so good .
she brings my tea and _num_ packages of sugar .
next i order a salmon caesar salad .
it arrives and the salmon is dry and flavorless .
i wo n't go there again .
if you 're a vegetarian , skip dinner .
just removing the meat does n't make a dish appealing .
tonight i went here for dinner on a date .
the restaurant was relatively empty - sunday night at _num_ .
i ordered the mushroom ravioli that was very undercooked .
there was no offer to make it right .
she just cleared the plate and offered the dessert menu .
her lack of concern was surprising .
this was not my first disappointing experience at this restaurant at this location .
hands down worst service i have ever had a restaurant .
she was very rude about it .
$ _num_ and no croutons .
and this place will not give you a piece of regular italian bread .
bread to scoop up all that sauce ?
nope , you ca n't get it at this place .
but you ca n't get a piece of freaking italian bread .
went to cafe boa the evening of march 3rd , _num_ .
however we waited almost _num_ mins to get our food .
the manager was totally unprofessional .
rip off !
i ordered their turkey sandwich , which was $ _num_ .
total rip off !
i am not exaggerating .
not too professional .
do n't order a half meal of ravioli and salad .
did you know there 's only _num_ ravioli in the full order ?
other than that , was not very impressed at all .
the menu looked impressive but the end food result was very lacking .
i do n't like paying for an expensive meal that is not good .
the $ _num_ salad i ordered was tiny and extremely bland .
even the $ _num_ peach appetizer just was n't good either .
the prosciutto did not taste right .
i just assumed that all business do that for their customers .
i was wrong .
cafe boa does not validate parking .
however , their service is truly terrible .
needless to say , reservation canceled only _num_ hours before the party !
we visited cafe boa on saturday night with a 7:30 reservation .
our experience was so disappointing on many levels .
today 's adventure was their rueben ... it was almost totally inedible .
do not bother coming here .
but the food , for the most part , is not .
not good .
worse yet , service was pleasant but very very slow .
horrible experience !
the dinner was ok , nothing special and was small in portion .
first , i brought cup cakes , they were not cut .
butter lettuce , walnuts literally that 's it with salmon .
probably wo n't eat there again .
i went here on saturday night for a friend 's birthday dinner .
it was very disappointing .
the fries were okay , though some were covered in chili powder .
we tried to find her , but we could n't see her anywhere .
she essentially gave herself a $ _num_ tip on a $ _num_ bill twice .
the food is fancy but is n't worth the price .
terrible .
very strange experience .
okay , anthony did n't tell me the specials nor the soup .
no water .
i would n't have ordered it if i knew it had meat .
anyway , bill comes & there 's a $ _num_ charge for the wine .
no one is here anthony says .
no one is ever here this early .
food was nothing special , even though they tried .
it sadly was not the experience i expected for a brunch .
and really , who is n't pretty easy when it comes to a mimosa ?
sour taste ( pun ? )
still exists from this delay and poor customer service .
if you like leaving a restaurant unsatisfied , this is the place .
the place was cold and the service was terrible .
the meal was small and unimpressive for the price .
if like leaving a restaurant unsatisfied , this is your place .
the restaurant was cold , the service was lousy and portions were small .
the food was unimpressive for the price .
disappointed we stopped by .
i assume that was to split the plates .
i wish restaurants could understand that .
the chef obviously does n't know how to be innovative with vegetables .
not one more piece of bread without paying for it !
no bread , no goodwill .
sorry , it 's been sitting around too long .
it 's such a pretty atmosphere ; too bad it 's gone lame .
might as well just shoot it .
she said no problem and that they cater to the theater crowd .
ordered our appetizers and entrees at the same time when she brought our drinks .
did n't see our cheese and meat board for _num_ min .
he did however refund $ _num_ per bill .
do n't go here for a large party .
_num_ hours after we ordered to get out food .
took _num_ minutes to figure out bills .
staff was unprofessional and not based on satisfying customers .
b - `` which one ? ''
this is a $ _num_ salad and i did n't enjoy it much .
if i could give half of a star , i would .
no flavor .
very dry .
their service , unfortunately , leaves much to be desired .
`` unfortunately , we do n't have anything available . ''
if you watch carefully you will see that it is all fake .
this place is bad .
my mom asks my dad and i `` is he leaving the bottle ?
strong fish is n't supposed to be good .
esp salmon , it should never taste that way .
the bill comes and that bottle of wine was $ _num_ .
never going back and will spread the word .
now do n't get me wrong , i like thai basil .
i ca n't ever seem to get enough , and i really mean that .
service is hit or miss here .
one thing that 's consistent : they always seem to be understaffed .
to me , thai basil is style over substance .
not impressed .
one thing that 's consistent : they always seem to be understaffed .
i 've canceled the order and walked out .
too many other choices to spend my money .
$ _num_ green curry w/ chicken called my name .
veggie soup with tofu came in a small bowl .
took a bite of eggroll and was disappointed to see * in the mix .
curry sauce was good , but looked too watery and not silky enough .
then we had rama 's favorite , which was basically beef with peanut sauce .
more like peanut butter -- the peanut was overpowering .
i even had to bring him to the er , it was so bad .
ok , i have only been here one time .
i asked my waiter how it was prepared .
waiter : `` well , mostly sour sauce . ''
`` no , not really . ''
the amount of fish was disappointing .
the sauce was below average .
there do n't seem to be many thai restaurants in the area .
the place is not set up for relaxed dining .
not the best thai place .
skip the pad thai ( worst i 've ever had . )
why only _num_ stars you are most likely wondering .
thai basil lacks a lot of flavor because everything was so watered down .
i asked for mild panang curry and my friend ordered the mild pad thai .
this was not the case here .
so freaking what if we dont like your disgusting food .
and this was _num_ reviews in one .
gross , i know .
got the veggie soup , it was salty and very peppery .
from the outside , not too shabby .
on entering , i saw _num_ tables seated .
i advised water would be great .
as i waited , i looked around the restaurant .
the salad and rice were presented to me in about _num_ minutes .
i figure i actually had about _num_ 1/2 cups of papaya salad .
disappointing since i ordered thai hot _num_ .
all the lettuce underneath was a disappointment .
rice was wrong , overcooked to nearly mush .
the food is not impressive .
they will not make my food spicy .
i could n't eat it .
worst thai food i 've had -- nearly inedible .
small menu , no spice rack .
drunken noodles did n't even taste like the right dish .
ordered pad thai chicken med spicy .
the portions are too big could have easily split it .
it was dry and really spicy for medium .
disappointed for sure .
i will not go back .
this place is all about big mediocre portions .
if you want to eat real thai food ... go elsewhere .
no traditional thai spices available .
ill never return !
not sure why people like this place so much .
the servers are always rushing around and the place seems understaffed .
i 've eaten lots of thai food and this place is less then memorable .
very average food and horrible service .
worst experience ever at a restaurant .
their food is average however the way they run their business is awful .
when the bill came again , two things struck me : _num_ . )
it went from $ _num_ to $ _num_ ; _num_ . )
i was very disappointed with this place .
apparently here medium means they do n't even use any sauce .
dry rice and tiny pieces of other ingredients is what i received .
sorry you hate your job but i never made you work here .
they ripped us off during lunch .
for three people , no booze .
sorry but i still feel cheated .
i seriously hate this place because of food poisoning !
i was very wrong .
they just handed me the money and turned around .
the food was disappointing to say the least .
my dish was bland , service was n't great .
not worth the price .
the place was empty and the quality still was n't even close to par .
unfortunately , this carried over to my entree as well .
i would n't come back here though .
i feel like this place is on par to fast food .
i wo n't be coming back .
large , well run and stocked indian grocery store .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
fried food , burgers , wraps and seafood are a dime a dozen .
everybody raves about this place .
just because a lot of people go there does n't make it amazing .
but , its impossible to get a table .
i agree with the poor reviews on this place .
i have found the food to be expensive and very boring .
the drinks are ok , the beer is ok , the atmosphere is ok .
however , i do n't , so i wo n't be returning anytime soon .
i have been here twice and both times sucked .
however , it is also highly , highly overrated .
for a real hole-in-the-wall , find a hole-in-the-wall .
we do n't know why this place has such a great reputation .
boring .
it 's just not that cool .
there 's also never any place to sit on a busy night .
dumb .
drinks are a bit over priced .
took all of _num_ seconds .
and the waitress did n't care .
and it was n't that good .
um ... stripper jumping out of a cake ?
or do you really not know how to spell desert ?
i really do n't get it .
it 's just plain bad .
patrons above the age of _num_ .
slow waitresses .
$ _num_ kiltlifter .
asshole cops that follow you home afterwards .
sorry , i just do .
the service is slow and the staff is generally pretty obnoxious .
otherwise , just head a few blocks away to four peaks .
it 's just a different type of obnoxious .
this place is for folks with too much to prove .
i do n't smoke cigarettes .
this place barely has an interior .
gross as hell .
i do n't get this place .
before we could even say anything , she had left .
only when she returned a third time did she finally ask us about food .
i 'm not sure how to describe them .
do n't waste your time here .
it 's a pain , and confusing .
not good .
music sucked , a bunch of shitty trendy crap .
the only thing redeeming were quality servers .
went to this place more then 3x 's never had a good experience here .
my friend gave the waitress his credit card to pay the bill .
my friend said , '' i gave you my credit card '' .
she said well , i do n't have it .
well _num_ hours later guess what ?
gave him a card for _num_ drinks next time .
believe me , there is no next time .
customer service does not exist here .
parking also can be difficult .
my last visit , however , really changed my perspective on this place .
it took over one and a half hours for us to get our entrees .
the balance of the whole sandwich was lost .
parking is rough and it 's a packed house especially on a saturday night .
first off i am _num_ , but no stick in the mud .
i write to save another business traveler the trouble of a horrible dining experience .
it is filled with college kids drinking cheap beer .
_num_ oysters .
_num_ of them bad from looking at them .
they look bad , they will taste worse .
horrible !
swimming in that cheap teriyaki goo they sell at any restaurant supply store .
everyone else stay far , far away .
i guess i could be in culinary hell here .
so bad in fact that i sent them back .
this place is constantly over crowded , and the staff is rude .
the second time i went with my husband and ordered a crab salad sandwich .
so , this place was already two for two .
but the service was horrible .
but no .
but let me tell you right now what makes me the most angry .
if i could give it zero stars i would .
i could n't believe my ears !
i have never been treated so badly in a restaurant before .
nothing special .
the people who own this business have no idea what they 've lost .
however , this is not the final straw for me .
so long casey moore 's .
maybe i order poorly , but my pasta was lame .
like i said , confusing !
the food was not impressive .
the fish was mediocre ... the batter was thin , not crispy at all .
it had no salt , flavor , or seasoning whatsoever .
the side dishes were met with the same lack of seasoning .
the fries were limp and had absolutely no salt .
_num_ .
i was not impressed at all with the property or location .
like i mentioned before .
_num_ .
the service is not spectacular either .
i walked in and was greeted by no one .
this was my first visit and needless to say my last !
this was the worst place ever .
in my burger , there was some mystery meat that i bit .
i would n't recommend this place to my worst enemy .
food , service , parking and decor are horrible .
the inside looks like a haunted house and the outside is a complete wreck .
i quickly paid my tab and got out of there .
it might have been because we did n't look like hipsters .
maybe we did n't have enough visible tattoos .
after our nice long wait for our food , the food was wrong .
our waitress was obviously bothered by our requests to get our food correct .
i forgot who ordered what but the sandwich was missing the bacon .
unless you have very low expectations of what a bar/restaurant should be .
but even then i think this place would disappoint .
total disappointment .
a total mess .
and apparently there is a bread shortage if you order clams or escargot .
the service here was absolutely horrible !
i arrived and it was fairly empty .
two waitresses split between _num_ people at _num_ tables .
by far the worst service i 've ever had at a restaurant .
ate the fried oysters , and some bbq wings .
oysters were pretty good this far out in the desert .
so needless to say the parking sucks .
if i could give zero stars i absolutely would .
i do n't eat chowder so i assured him i did n't .
btw , chowder , according to my boyfriend was terrible .
i asked them to remove the steak as i was done .
probably one of the worst restaurant experiences i 've ever had .
once the bouncers hand was washed off his cut was clearly not a bite .
if you tell anyone about what happened you 're not allowed back here .
i just can not say too many good things about this place .
it is busy all the time though so someone likes it .
looking back it has been here for at least _num_ years .
oyster house , i would not trust eating seafood here my friend .
just an old place that people like to drink at .
nothing to really brag about .
place is old and had a funky smell when you walk inside .
i would say this is more a local watering hole then a restaurant .
there are better places to go then here for oysters and other food .
it was my bad that i did n't count when i took it .
the hubs and i had to try this place passed it several times .
had the oysters , calamari , halibut and ahi .
i 'm not a cat person and having them near food is unsanitary !
but no !
i wo n't go back since there are plenty of places with decent staff .
but the servers are not all that friendly .
i 'm hoping next time i come i 'll have a better experience .
the service was horrific .
honestly if the wings were n't so good i would n't go back .
the tables outside seemed dirty and the service was mediocre .
wo n't go back .
wish it had been my choice !
would we go back , i only know i would n't .
this review is long overdue .
maybe i 'm getting too old for this , but seriously ... .
my husband finished off the rest .
but this is my review , not his , so two it is .
i wo n't be back .
management says bartender made a `` judgement call '' .
management sucks .
skip this place and spend your hard earned bucks somewhere else .
horrible !
horrible !
horrible !
_num_ minutes to get our two orders of oyster rockefeller .
however , food was comped because we complained .
literally the worst place i have ever eaten in my entire life .
i did n't know that a restaurant could serve dog meat in america .
i would not wish this hole on an enemy .
at least the kids linguine soaked in vegetable oil will shoot through them quickly .
on the bright side our waitress only visited our table three times .
next , he ignored us and sat down watching the game .
wow , ate there the other day with my family and was very disappointed .
tough & way too fatty .
really disappointed in this place .
complete joke and very unprofessional .
this place goes to show you that crooks wo n't stay in business long .
i 'm glad i trusted my gut on this one .
we tried to , the pro was a jerk and service was terrible .
the course was in decent shape for the price paid .
however , the service is lacking every time i come here .
me know what was wrong .
and i could wait in there lobby .
after driving for _num_ miles , the problem still remained with absolutely no improvement .
nick also gave us all of the old parts that he had replaced .
do n't take your car here .
rip off !
stop raising our rates you douche bags .
again ridiculous !
they charge an initial $ _num_ deposit .
seriously , they are not business friendly .
why can you not pay their overpriced bills with a credit card .
why do we not have another choice for our electric ?
another $ _num_ deposit !
my pool pump does n't go on until 9:00 pm .
i do n't cook inside in the summer .
only after 8:00 pm , even on the weekends .
_num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
this is beyond ridiculous !
scam .
we tried it for _num_ month and switched back to basic .
but i guess they do n't base it off of your credit .
ridiculous !
_num_ to _num_ .
unfortunately , they have repeatedly let me down .
needless to say , this ruined my appetite .
_num_ years ago i joined az cu as a student and got screwed over .
i once got $ _num_ out of the atm to pay for food .
i complained and got nowhere with their unfriendly customer service .
i was disappointed on all _num_ counts .
_num_ .
_num_ and _num_ .
_num_ .
_num_ .
throughout my mortgage application process , i was promised a _num_ % interest rate .
the site kept showing _num_ % for days or weeks afterwards .
the customer service is terrible and their atm never works right .
i would give them a _num_ star if i could .
worst company i have worked with since i have had my business .
she demanded the $ _num_ to cancel the contract .
that is a $ _num_ product .
do not trust them with access to your account .
as a small business they have almost ruined me .
if i could give this company _num_ stars , i would .
do not trust them with your financial information .
i 'm a small business and they totally ruined me .
the tacos i got literally looked like the ones at jack in the box .
it was a week day during the lunch hours .
poor food and even worse service .
this is not real mexican food .
the beans were good but the concept was not understood .
everything else was bland .
a little over priced too .
i doubt i 'll be back .
nothing is authentic here , too much cheese , beans and not much flavor .
i was even more confused .
needless to say , i will not be back .
gross .
another five to six minutes go by .
it 'll be awhile before i come back to this location again .
he said the veggies were so greasy he could n't eat them .
greasy , greasy .
a tv dinner would have tasted fresher .
now , sadly we cross off yet another mexican restaurant here in tempe .
no one near us knows how to cook fajitas .
unfortunately it is about an hour drive from our house .
wish i had better news for you people craving some good mexican food .
that is no excuse .
at this rate , another valley landmark might soon be going away .
we ate there and the food went downhill too .
mediocre food ... i can cook that at home !
i 've eaten here at least _num_ times in the past _num_ years .
i was not impressed with this place .
water and tea has a musty taste .
salsa was too chunky .
i was a customer for over _num_ years until december 9th .
i order the same thing every time .
the mini appetizer substitute fundido instead of guacamole .
apparently at this location that is n't allowed .
a side of fundido is $ _num_ they say .
does n't make sense .
here , blah .
do n't waste your time .
this is not really a mexican restaurant .
even the guacamole did not taste right .
my chips were never refilled i had to ask .
i wo n't be back .
salsa does n't have a bite so to me it 's lacking .
beverage delivery to our table was super slow .
two entree with one side combo was n't quite prepared right .
mexican veggies side and black beans had cheese all over them .
service was n't what i would have expected .
my son is particular about his food as he is _num_ .
we have done this before and there was never a problem there .
my mom and i left feeling very disappointed .
no way .
so my mom and i left and ate somewhere else .
could he bend a rule for a _num_ year old ?
i felt very disappointed in the customer service of the manager .
i was very disappointed .
i understand that the staff is short , they are looking to hire .
water , chips , salsa , etc .
but , our service was not good at all .
we made the mistake in sitting in the cantina though .
the worst human i 've encountered in at least _num_ years .
offensive , tacky , and unprofessional .
terrible service .
bad food .
empty drink forever .
wo n't be back to this one .
my daughter did n't get her food even started until we got ours .
awful experience .
when we asked for the manager she came and removed the cold food .
the food is great but it 's a shame the management is so terrible .
immediately we asked to see a manager and tammy ignored our request .
what tammy did tonight at our table was highly illegal .
legal action will be taken if not addressed or ignored .
not a good experience with management .
manager made me feel like she was doing me a one time favor .
could have been avoided all together if the serving staff knew the menu better .
bad drivers , too fast and out of control .
messy store , dirty , sticky counters .
overhead music playing and a radio playing different music loud .
lets start with the poor customer service .
even when they have the staff to take care of it .
the floor in the fountain area is always dirty too .
have to agree ; probably the worst place for `` seafood '' around .
talk about annoying - the wait staff , especially .
no , it 's not the service .
i guess eating mediocre food in peace is n't good enough .
that 's your warning .
absurd .
the food is n't that much better , either .
instead of a headache , you get to walk away with an upset stomach .
so , why _num_ stars ?
the waitress recommended sam adam 's oktoberfest instead .
what i would n't give right now for another pint of oktoberfest .
the crunchy fish sandwich is usually served with cheese .
i asked for mine without , but regretted it immediately .
no taste .
save your time and money and avoid this place !
if you 're looking for seafood , go to the salt cellar .
at least there , you 'll get what you pay for .
( not to mention the blue dye they have in their fake pond outside .
what the hell is that about ? )
i will never go to this horrid place again .
horrible !
i was sick for two days after eating here .
the decor is the only thing this place had in common with it .
did n't like the taste of the broccoli .
i 'm kinda bummed that this place lived up to the bad reviews .
the hosts seemed to have no clue what they were doing .
they seated tables that were obviously still dirty which was gross .
i wish the experience was better than it was .
unfortunately i probably wo n't go back here .
looking around , there did n't seem to be a server in our area .
waiting waiting waiting again .
in all , not a positive experience .
my girlfriend 's salad was more dressing than anything else .
the food was so-so , but the service was dismal .
i will never return to this restaurant .
i decided to return again and ordered the crab cakes , big mistake .
they exchanged them for some fired shrimp but the damage had been done .
things seem to have really gone downhill since then .
the food and the service at this `` restaurant '' are equally terrible .
this did n't even include ordering food , much less getting it .
the food is very bland .
i 've tried this place a few times , that was my last time .
the food is not good to me .
i 've been there at least _num_ times .
food is very bland .
and just not very good .
the place was okay , i went there saturday night .
so my boyfriend and i gave it a try .
i ate the shrimp alfredo and my boyfriend had a burger .
and the food is better and a lot less expensive .
i 've been to other joe 's crab shack 's that were much better .
this one had extremely slow service .
not only that , but i had to keep asking the waiter for refills .
no bueno .
tried this place with the little one after a visit to the mall .
we were both very disappointed .
the food was absolutely terrible .
neither of us could eat more than a few bites and then we left .
this place in general is a little too cheesy for me .
they offer mediocre seafood with over the top waitstaff .
it is almost like you are buying a used car .
the food itself is just ok .
nothing to write home about .
cody forgot my chowder and didnt apologize .
walked in for lunch , the place was empty .
sat down waited five minutes with no welcome or drink order , walked out .
i was pretty disappointed on this visit .
once we arrived , we still had to wait for a half hour .
they had way too much pepper for one thing and no breading at all .
all my elderly parents ordered was a bowl of soup each .
the soup came out the first time cold -- ok , that is understandable .
`` ) , once again , the soup was cold .
no visit from the manager ?
the place was very loud .
over all , over priced and loud .
should receive zero stars .
we were seated by a table of about _num_ , _num_ were children .
the worst experience i have ever had after spending a $ _num_ .
my wife ordered the queen crab pot with a garlic butter sauce .
service overall was very slow .
the meals , save for the crab legs , were generally over salted .
the stuffed shrimp were ... .
that 's the only way to describe it .
the tartar sauce they gave me may as well have been mayonnaise .
the reason for my _num_ stars is because of the service .
i 'll get my seafood fix somewhere else .
food was poorly cooked and greasy and way overpriced .
we will never go to joes crab shack again .
slow service mediocre to lousy food .
will not be back .
one star just for the hospitality , _num_ $ for four pounds !
lack of flavor !
i absolutely love joes but not this location and here 's why .
( bed hair and all ) and they had no energy at all !
the place was so noisy we could n't hear each other talk .
the skillet paella dish has been removed .
_num_ % + was breading .
the calamari was too large and rubbery .
not small and tender .
should have gone to pollo loco in the arizona mills shopping center .
the problem was with the menu .
crab cake was extremely salty .
not a good experience with the exception of our server matt .
they kept picking up the phone and just hanging up .
no apology whatsoever .
guess you 're too busy for these customers because we will never be returning .
my husband and i both became ill after eating here .
very disappointed , next time i 'll go to red lobster !
this was a horrible experience from beginning to end .
disgusting .
but , it gets worse from there .
recall , if you will , the place was almost empty .
the crab cake was cold in the middle .
the fried fish and onion rings tasted like old grease .
there was almost no fish inside the greasy batter .
the only thing that was good was the french fries .
i hardly ate anything on the plate .
then the waiter came out to bring out drinks and his hand was bleeding .
it was just an overall bad experience .
it seems like our experience gets worse the more we visit .
crab was overcooked too .
and finally , our bill was wrong .
poor experience .
it seems like our experience gets worse the more we visit .
crab was overcooked too .
and finally , our bill was wrong .
poor experience .
however when the check arrived , the appetizer was charged .
this was no mistake .
then the _num_ min wait happened to get drinks delivered to the table .
side orders were forgotten because waiter was not using note pad .
i am extremely disappointed with the service i received from this place .
mistake # _num_ and still no manager .
food was good but service was horrible .
very poor service , unfriendly , inattentive , food was just barely fair .
once before we were there an never got waited on .
however , it 's been more than _num_ years since my last visit .
my husband had never even heard of them , let alone dined there .
for me , when i walked in , it was just like old times .
the bright side is he brought out our drinks correctly .
and this is where the problems came about .
however , the manager 's responses were great .
for my husband , not so much .
my husband would have given it one star because of the entire experience .
we came late , on a saturday night , and were quickly seated .
in total , we were probably helped by _num_ different servers .
it 's way too loud .
i could n't hold a conversation with my date .
it was very annoying .
the food is not fresh .
with tip and no booze , for _num_ people was $ _num_ .
the meal was $ _num_ tops .
i ate half of it before i noticed .
this is n't a great place .
should have tipped me off .
_num_ tv 's were showing different sports channels above the bar .
the food was nothing above ok .
do n't you want your special to be the things you do well ?
just make sure you 've eaten dinner before you go .
ps - and do n't use the bathroom unless you really really have to .
so far the worst italian i 've had in the valley .
`` no , '' she said .
`` i ca n't talk right now .
big mistake .
more like ... cardboard .
mmmm ... cardboard parmesan .
seriously , it was gross .
it came with a side of spaghetti , which was all right .
not as gross as the eggplant , but still not good .
bad service , bad food .
the eggplant parmesan was paper thin and extremely over fried .
the drinks were weak .
very weak .
the meal was one of the worst i have had in ages .
hands down , i will not be returning .
i would hate to see the place with the lights on !
even the service was only fair .
do n't waste your time or money !
do n't eat here .
they tasted like watered down coke .
maybe it was the _num_ yr old bartender .
the pizza was just ok , far from amazing .
i adore cats , but not in restaurants .
unfortunately there is n't a lower rating for this joke of a bar .
i will not be going back and urge you to support another local establishment .
this restaurant deserves no stars .
the second was there was not a server in sight .
after about _num_ minutes , a sever did appear from the back somewhere .
bad sign # _num_ .
bad sign # _num_ .
cheese and sauce were some odd orange color with a awful taste .
i threw this pizza out the next day .
she said no , and that no one else had complained .
the owner came over and questioned me .
i mean , they were n't going to give me fresh beer ?
sorry guys , definitely lost this customer .
i wo n't be back .
the house salad is really poor .
when i went there the other day the service was really terrible .
i was wrong .
my wife got the wrong dressing but ate it anyway .
we continued to dessert despite my better judgement .
forty dollars and tip for a meal this bad is ridiculous !
all i can imagine is the place is paying you to post on yelp .
and a boston bar , no less .
it 's a little expensive for a dive bar too .
there 's too many other bars within a block to waste time there .
the food is only okay and you can only get beer and wine here .
i struggled to find any flavor at all in the pizza .
crust was very tasteless .
got a caprese , tomatoes were hard and pink .
that is just flat out nuts .
_num_ .
_num_ .
pizza was great but the worst customer service ever .
it was 9:30 by the time my pizza came .
the weak instant iced tea was priced at $ _num_ .
if these prices seem just a little high , its because they are !
however , the quality of the food was just ... ... ok .
the thin sliced sausage was alright , but not spectacular .
this place is overpriced and not very good .
crust is tough , toppings are minimal .
never again folks .
we were very disappointed with this place .
my pizza , a sausage pie , came out burned .
i tasted charcoal more than i did sausage .
she should have noticed the burnt pie , however .
it 's not .
in a bad way .
the vegetarian pizza , however , did n't look too appetizing .
the taste is where it all fell apart .
the wood burning oven taste was not there .
there was n't the smoky flavor you 'd expect .
or drove ten more miles and went to bianco .
bad ?
no way .
no how .
embarrassed to walk out i gave it a try to see if any good .
ordered a margarita pizza for it was cheapest .
what i got was a cheese sprinkled with basil and that was it .
at any rate the pizza was plain and a little dry .
also there was no wood oven taste .
not worth it and was not very good .
the worst pizza ever .
pizza dough isnt supposed to taste like wonder bread , all doughy & sweet .
this place is an insult to italian pizza .
just sad .
there were _num_ strips of sausage , _num_ pepperoni slices and _num_ mushroom slices .
not a good start , to say the least .
after hearing the rave reviews from neighbors , i finally tried their pizza .
i thought it was ok , but nothing super special .
nope sorry !
the crust was pathetic .
the cheese on the pizza was not bad .
